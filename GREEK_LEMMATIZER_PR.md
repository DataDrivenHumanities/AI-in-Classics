## Pull Request Title
Add Greek Lemmatizer Workflow Matching Latin Approach

## Pull Request Description
This PR implements a Greek lemmatizer workflow that follows the same pattern as the Latin lemmatizer workflow. It provides a complete solution for lemmatizing Greek text using the existing dictionary files.

### Features Implemented
- Created `GreekDictFunctions.py` with core lemmatization functionality
- Implemented `demonstrate_greek_workflow.py` to showcase the workflow
- Added `greek_lemmatizer_workflow.py` with web scraping capabilities for future dictionary expansion
- Created comprehensive documentation in `WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`

### Implementation Details
The implementation consists of:

1. **Core Dictionary Functions**
   - Loading dictionary data from CSV files
   - Word lookup and lemmatization
   - Text analysis
   - Form generation

2. **Workflow Documentation**
   - Detailed workflow diagram showing data flow
   - Implementation plan for future improvements
   - Technical guide with code examples

3. **Demonstration Scripts**
   - Complete workflow demonstration with sample Greek words and texts
   - Example implementation that matches the Latin lemmatizer approach

### Testing
The Greek lemmatizer has been tested with various Greek words and passages including:
- Common Greek words (λόγος, ἄνθρωπος, etc.)
- Short Greek passages ("ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος", etc.)
- Stem matching for words not directly in the dictionary

### Next Steps
Future improvements could include:
- Enhanced dictionary data with more comprehensive Greek lexical entries
- Improved matching algorithms for Greek morphology
- More sophisticated stemming for ancient Greek forms
