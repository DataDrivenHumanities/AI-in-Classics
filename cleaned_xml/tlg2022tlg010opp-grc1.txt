  ΘΕΟΛΟΓΙΚΟΣ TETAPTOS. ΠΕΡΙ YIOY.  Ἐπειδή σοι τὰς μὲν ἐκ τῶν λογισμῶν στροφὰς καὶ

3 πάρα] ἄπο b || 6 om μὲν b 1. We have gone rapidly through
the Eunomian objections, especially
those taken from Scripture, and have
laid down a general canon for the
interpretation of the texts. We will
now take the texts seriatim. 1. στροφάς] Cp. iii 16. πλακὰς
is likewise a wrestling metaphor. 2. διεσείσαμεν] Διασείειν is to
‘shake to pieces,’ used of a
examination. Plut. de Gen.
Socr. 580 D διερωτῶν καὶ διασείων
τὸν Εὐθύφρονα. There seems to be
no connexion with the preceding
metaphors. 4. τοῦ γρ. ἱερόσυλοι] explained
by the next clause, τὸν νοῦν..,κλἐπτ.
The ‘letter’ is like a temple, which
the sacrilegious heretic robs of its
‘meaning.’ 5. σφετερίζονται] ‘take possession
of.’ 10. τῷ νέῳ . . . ‘A δάμ] The phrase
is not free from danger. An ἱερόσυλος
τοῦ γράμματος might make
out that the νέος ’Α. was, in ’s
view, a different person from the
Divine Person implied in τῆ θεότητι.
Cp. iii 18, 19. It must be remembered
that the Nestorian heresy
had not yet been formulated. ib. θεῷ παθητῷ] a daring oxymoron.
Gr. would of course deny that
the Godhead of Christ was subjected
to suffering, though the Divine Person
was so subjected, in virtue of
the nature which He assumed.  Ἔστι γὰρ ἓν μὲν αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖνο καὶ λίαν πρόχειρον
τό· Κύριος ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἔργα αὐτοῦ.
πρὸς ὃ πῶς ἀπαντησόμεθα; οὐ Σολομῶντος κατηγορήσομεν;
οὐ τὰ πρὶν ἀθετήσομεν διὰ τὴν τελευταίαν παράπτωσιν;

ταύτα aceg 2. 6 ἐν] ἐν cdeg || 11 τεχνίτου] τεχνικοῦ eg 1. π. κατὰ τῆς ἁμ] a compact
expression; ‘suffering against sin,’
i.e. overcoming sin by means of
suffering. 2. No. 1. — The Lord created Me
...with a view to His works. We
will not shirk the difficulty by making
the words a mere personification.
It is our Lord who speaks. But the
cause which He alleges to have been
in vircv at His creation shews that
He is speaking of the creation of His
manhood, which was created ivith a
view to the works of verity and judgment
in our salvation. When afterwards
He speaks of His Godhead,
He uses very different language; He
begetteth Me — there is no cause there. 6. λαὶ λίαν πρόκ.] ‘exceedingly
handy.’ The μὲν is answered
πρὸς δ πῶς ἀπ’. 7. K. ἔκτισέ με] Prov. viii 11.
The Heb. word is kanah, not bara
which is the word used in Gen. i 1.
It signifies comparare; and prob.
κτᾶσθαι (which is the rendering of
Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion)
is nearer to it than the LXX.
κτίζειν. Cp. Bas. adv. Eun. ii 20.
Into that question, however, Gr. does
not enter. 9. τὴν τελ. παράπτωσιν] sc.
Solomon's. 10. τῆς σοφίας αὐτῆς] ’of Wisdom
itself,’ as distinct from that
Person in whom all wisdom is
gathered up and displayed. Delitzsch,
commenting on the passage in Prov.,
says, "Wisdom is not God, but
’s; she has personal existence
in the Logos of the N.T., but is not
herself the Logos." Gr. further explains
this Wisdom, to be ’the
science, so to speak, and the artistic
principle ὅκ’ which the universe is
composed.’ Gr. intends to
carefully the τεχν. λόγος from the
person of ’the Word.’ 13. ἢ θάλασσα. . . ἢ ἄβυσσος] Job
xxviii 14; cp. Is. xxiii 4. 14. οἱ οὐρανοί] ’s. xviii 2 (xix Ι). 1 διηγοῦνται b || 5 ’δε] καὶ e ΙΙ 6 ἔχει] ἔχοι df II 9 παντως] πάντας
g || 11 εὑρίσκωμεν] ομεν a 1 ῥομφαία] Zech. xiii 7; cp Jer, xlvii 6 μάχαιρα). 3. εἰ καί τισι τῶν πρὸ ἡμ.] He
prob. refers to Basil, who, in the Hom.
in Princ. Proverb. ἑ 3, where he has
no controversial animus, expounds
very strikingly the ’personification’
of that wisdom which speaks to us
out of nature. Very likely other
Catholic authors adopted the same
view. Bas. himself, however,
when in controversy with the Eunomians,
gives the same account as
Gr. does here (adv. Enn. iv p. 293
Ληπτέον οὖν . . . ἐπὶ τοῦ τὴν μορφὴν
δούλου λαβόντος). That account, it
may be added, is derived from
Athanasius, who says (de Deer. Nic.
Syn. p. 220 B), To δὲ πρόσωπον τοῦ
μὲν σωτῆρός ἐστι, τότε δὲ λέγεται ὅτε
λοιπὸν λαβὼν τὸ σῶμα λέγει κτλ. Cp.
the fuller passage in Ath. Or. ii c.
Ar. ἑ 44 f.; also Eus. adv. Marcell.
ii 3. Among other expositors whom
Gr. knew, Origen (de Princ. i 2)
identifies Wisdom with the eternal
Son, and, though he does not admit
any imaginable period before the
generation of Wisdom, thinks that
Wisdom speaks of herself as having
been created, inasmuch as she comtains
in herself from the outset the
beginnings and outlines of the creation
that was to be. Denys of Rome
on the other hand (in Ath. de Deer.
Nic. Syn. Ρ. 232) dwells upon the
various significations of the word
κτίζειν in the Bible, and understands
it here to mean ’appointing,’ ‘setting
over the works which were
made through ’ For another
explanation, with which, however,
Gr. was hardly likely to be acquinted,
see nil. de Trin. xii 35
foil. 7. ἢ τοῦτο] ‘otherwise this;’
which is the ’cause’ of God, ’would
be prior to God.’ 10. τὸ γεννᾷ με] Prov. viii 25. 11. μετὰ τῆς αἰτίας] ‘coupled with
a mention of cause.’ 15. ἀλήθεια κ. κρίσις] Ps. ex (cxi)
7. These, which are the works of
our salvation τοῦ σωθῆναι π. ἡμᾶς),
are identified as ’the works’ with
view to which Wisdom was ‘created.’  τούτω δὲ ἕπεται καὶ τὸ δοῦλον ἀκούειν εὖ δουλεύοντα
πολλοῖς, καὶ τὸ μέγα εἶναι αὐτῷ κληθῆναι
παῖδα θεοῦ. τῷ ὄντι γὰρ ἐδούλευσε σαρκί, καὶ γενέσει,
καὶ πάθεσι τοῖς ἡμετέροις, διὰ τὴν ἡμετέραν ἐλευθερίαν,
καὶ πᾶσιν οἷς σέσωκεν ὑπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας κατεχομένους. 3. 10 κατεχομενους] -οις f 1. ἐχρίσθη θεότητι] Gr. falls
again into the danger of Nestorian
language, and speaks as if there
were a created person (identified
with the created ’Wisdom’) who
was ’anointed with Godhead.’
mention of unction is so abrupt that
I cannot help suspecting that in
some version accessible to Gr. the
word nissachti in Prov. viii 23 Ἱ
was set ’) was translated ‘Ι was
anointed.’ So the Heb. word
understood by Fiirst, Bertheau, and
others; but I know no other indication
of such a rendering in any
ancient version. 4. τὴν κάτω γ.] ‘His birth upon
earth.’ 5. πλόον ἄληπτον] used instead
of ἀληπτοτέρα bee. it implies more
decidedly that ἡ κάτω γ. was itself
ἄληπτος. 3. Under the same head come the
texts tvhich speak of Him ἃς a Servant,
vant, and make it a great thing for
Him to be called a child of God. His
Incarnation did indeed put Him in a
state ὁ servitude; and it ὕας indeed
α great thing for His manhood to be
so united to God. 6. εὖ δουλ. πολλοῖς] Is. liii 11. 7. μέγα. . . παῖδα θ.] Is. xlix 6.
From what follows, it seems that Gr.
(and his opponents) understood
παῖδα = τέκνον or υἱόν. 8. ἐδοὑλ. σαρκί] Gr. seems to
be undecided whether to take πολ.
λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λένεσις,
πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν
οἶς κτλ. The ’Attic attraction’
οἶς misled De Billy into supposing
that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus
illis per quae). It is difficult to
determine whether the same mistake
caused the copyists to write κατεχομένους,
or whether Gr. himself
neglected to complete the attraction
by saying (as he should have done)
κατεχομένοις. That Ue ’s translation
is wrong is shewn by the
absence of the article before κατεχομένους;
if Gr. had meant ’and all
those things whereby He hath saved
those who were enslaved,’ he
have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. In view of
the preponderating authority for
κατεχομένους, it seems best to retain
it in the text, understanding it to be
a construction ad sensum, agreeing
with the οὓς which lies hidden in
the attracted ὄις.  Δεύτερον δὲ τί τῶν μεγίστων αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀμάχων;
δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν βασιλεύειν ἄχρι τοῦδε καὶ ὑπ’ οὐρανοῦ
δεχθῆναι ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως, καὶ τὴν ἐκ δεξιῶν
καθέδραν ἔχειν, ἕως τῆς τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐπικρατήσεως. τὸ 4 τὸ ὄνομα] om τὸ cef || 8 ὅτι kcu] om καὶ f 4. 16 ἀπωσθῆναι] αποσθηναι
ac: ἀποστῆναι e || om τὴν ag 1. μεῖζον] in ref. to μέγα above. ib. θεῷ πλακῆναι] again has a
Nestorian sound. 2. μίξεως] On this and similar
words as applied to the Incarnation
see Petavius de Inc. iii 2. ib. ἐπισκ. ἀνατολῇ] Luke i 78.
Gr. prob. forgot the context of the
words, and thought that they were
used in the address of Gabriel to
the B.V.M. or some such place.
His meaning here is plainly that the
human nature assumed by the Son
of God was thus ’visited.’ 3. τὸ γεννώμενον ἅγ.] Luke i 35. 4. χαρισθῆναιαὐτῷ τὸὄ.] Phil, ii 9. 6."/> πᾶν γόνυ... τῷ κενωθέντι] Phil.

Begotten? as distinct from the κτίσμα.
Tαῦτα refers to the whole series from
τί δὲ μεῖζον onwards. 4. No. 2. He must reign until.
The word until does not always
negative the extension of the alleged
action beyond the time mentioned.
And besides, Christ's reign is two-
fold. It is absolute, even over the
refractory; and it is progressive,
over those who are made willing to
submit, In the first sense it never
ends, in the second it ends with the
completion of the submission. 12. δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν β.] 1 Cor. xv

You find yourself in that plight because

Ps. lxxxi (lxxxii) 1.  τούτῳ σύναπτε καὶ τὴν ὑποταγήν, ἢν ὑποτάσσεις

of the Son. It speaks of Him
in us, or of us in Him. When we
are wholly subject, then Christ, our
becomes subject, and not before.
And so far from our language
implying that the Son at at present
in α state of rebellion, it is He who
brings about our sztbjectiou. So also
when He cries Why hast Thou for-
saken Me ? it is we who speak in His
person . 1. σύναπτε] ‘ Connect with this.’ 2. τί, ληεις, ὡς] The words are
those of the Eunomian, from τί to
τὸν λόγον ; unless perh. the first
question, τί λέγεις, is addressed to
the Eunomian, in the sense, ‘ Why
do you speak as if we made out
that ’etc. The Catholic, of course,
following St Paul, spoke of a future
’subjection’ of the Son to the Fation
ther. The Eunomian, who wished
to make out that the ’s position
is always and necessarily a subHead,
ordinate one, as being that of a
creature, retorted, ’What? is He
not subject now, but requires to be
reduced to subjection, — although
you make Him out to be God ?
Such language is only suitable to a
robber, or to a rival claimant of the

καἰ οὐκ εἰς ἄνοιαν ἐμοί ; vs. 1 οἱ λόγοι

of the Pss. in the LXX. differs from
that in the Hebrew. 6. His learning obedience, His
strong crying and tears, are a sacred
in which He represents us,
entering into a full realisation of
οἶσ’ circumstances. He learns by
personal experience to be lenient to
our falls. When the text in question
proceeds to say that God will be all
in all, it does not mean the Father
as distinguished from the Son, but
the Godhead as α whole. 13. μαθεῖν] Heb. v 8 ; cp. vs. 7. 16. δραματουργεῖται] ‘ It ἲς a
drama, wonderfully constructed for
our advantage.’ ’The saint,’ says
Elias, ’ applies the name of a drama
to that which our Saviour endured
as representing mankind. He does
not mean that it was unreal and
fictitious, like other dramas; but
only that Christ impersonates and
plays the part of the human ’
i.e. not the part which belongs
perly to His eternal and divine self. 17. τῶν). ὒ. χεῖρα τ.] The

neither obedient nor disobedient.
Such language applies only to subjects
and inferiors. Τὸ μέν, sc. ὑπήκοος;

a form which is not His own.’ 4. δαπανήσῃ] ‘consume,’ and so
‘destroy.’ Cp. ἑ 18 δαπανητικὸν τῶν
μοχθηρῶν ἕξεων; v 10 δαπανώμενον. 6. ἔργω not merely by precept. 8. διὰ τ. πρ. χώρ’.] i give it practical
effect' ; lit. ’proceed by way
action.' 10. δοκιμάζει] ’is applying a test
to’; not in the usual sense, by
temptation of us, but by Himself
experiencing what temptation must
be to us. So He takes a measure
of all that we go through, by means
of His own sufferings. It may seem
as if κἀκεῖνο were but a repetition
of what had already been said in
ἔργῳ τιμᾷ τ. ὑπακ. κ. πειρᾶται ταύτης.
The difference is that in the earlier
sentences Gr. speaks of us as represented
by Christ ; we suffer, as it
were, and obey in Him. Here he
states the converse truth, that Christ
identifies His lot with ours; He
enters into our experiences in order
to know at first hand what obedience
on our part costs. 11. τέχνῃ φιλανθρ.] by a
which His love of man (Tit. iii 4)
suggested. 12. ποσὸν μὲν ἀπαιτ.] De Billy
translates quantumque et a nobis exigi
et condonari debeat, which gives the
required sense, but is grammatically
impossible. If πόσον be read, the
only possible meaning is that Christ
learns by practical experience what
is demanded of us and what allowance
is made for us. This, however,
is unsatisfactory, so far as
συγχωρ. is concerned. It is best to
read ποσόν, and to make ἀπαιτ.,
συγχωρ., independent verbs coordinate
with δοκιμ., μετρεῖ. They thus
express the result of ’s gracious
experiment ; ‘ and a certain
ἲς still made upon us, and a
allowance is now made ὂν us, our
infirmity being taken into account
along with what we have to bear.’ 14. τὸ φῶς...σκοτίᾳ] John i 5. 4 ἐκείνου διαφυγ.] κἀκείνου φυγόντος b || καὶ] γε df 1. διὰ τὸ πρόβλημα] ‘ because of
the screen (or shade) ’ which partly
concealed Him. The πρόβλημα was
the fleshly nature which Christ assumed.
If it had not been for that,
the Evil One would not have ventured
to ‘ persecute ’ Him. The
thought is a favourite one with Gr.
Cp. Or. xxiv 9 πεῖραν προσάγει τῷ

Lightfoot on Ign. Eph. § 19, and
Petaviua de Inc. ii 5. 3. τὸ σκότος πόσον] διωχθήσεται.
Τὸ σκ.=ἡμεῖς, cp. Eph. v 8. It is
difficult to draw any distinction
between σκότος and σκοτία ; but
σκότος is more concrete, so to speak,
and possibly in the preceding clause
τοῦ πονηροῦ is intended for a gen.
dependent upon σκοτίας, not in app.
to it. 4. ποσῶς καὶ καταλ.] The word
is chosen with ref. to John i 5. Although
Christ escaped uninjured
from the temptation, it is not wonderful,
Gr. says, that we should
(not only be ‘ persecuted ’ by the
tempter but) even to some extent
be ’overtaken.’ The wonder is
that He should even have been
subject to assault, not that we
should fail under it. 7. ἐν ᾦ γὰρ π.] Heb. ii 18. 9. ξσται δέ ὁ θ. τὰ π.] 1 Cor.
xv 28. Gr. resumes the discussion
from § 4. τῆς ἀποκ. , Acts iii 21. 11. οὐχ ὁ π.] Gr. will not allow
that ὁ θεὸς here = ὁ πατήρ, as otherwise
it would suggest that the Son
is ’resolved’ again into Him, in
Sabellian fashion, — like a brand
snatched for a time out of a great
burning pile and then joined to it
again.  τρίτον ἀρίθμει τό· μεῖζον· τέταρτον τό· θεόν

not wish the Sabellians either
μηδέ), i.e. any more than the
Eunomians, to wrest this text to
their own destruction. Elias seems
to tke παραφθ. in a deponent
sense, but without authority. 2. ὅλος θεός] God in the most
unrestricted sense. Exegetically Gr.
is no doubt wrong: ὁ θεός, as usual,
means the Father, to whom the Son
Himself has just been said to be
made subject. But his suggestion
of the way in which the great result
will be brought about is full of
beauty. 3. κινήμασι] motions of will, like
κίνησις in iii 2. 5. ὅλοι θεοειδεῖς] not = πάντες θ.
He means that we shall be entirely
Godlike, Godlike through and
through, capable of taking in all
God and nothing but God. 6. ἡ τελ. πρὸς ἢν σπ] Perh. a

St Ρ. is not here speaking of the

greater; My God and your God. He
is greater inasmztch as the Son springs
from Him, — the Son who elsewhere
is called His equal ; it implies no
superiority of nature. 12. μεῖζον] John xiv 28. The
use of the neut. does not imply that
Gr. found it in his text of St John,
where it would convey a wholly
false impression. It is used in an
abstract way, as it is used six lines
below, τὸ μεῖζον μέν ἐστι κτλ. ib. θεόν μου] John xx 17. 15. γεννάδαι] iron, ’these fine

we must suppose that the
word ’greater’ refers to causation,
and ’equal ’ to nature. 3. ὑπὸ π. εὐγν.] an idiomatic use
of the prep., similar to that after a
pass. verb. Cp. v 33. ib. ἡμεῖς] ‘ we ’ as distinguished
from the ἄλλος τις. 4. ἡμετέρῳ] Although most of the
best MSS. read ὑμ., that reading seems
to a misunderstanding. Gr. has
just admitted ὁμολογ. ἡμεῖς) that
the Father is greater than the Son
by reason of being His αἰτία. Some
one else, he says, of course on the
orthodox side, might find fault with
for the admission, and urge that
in this case no manner of inferiority
attaches to being ’caused’ and not
’cause.’ As Gr. has already (iii II )
made the remark in his own person,
it is only a rhetorical device to

monem nostrum acriori animi conib.
tentione prosequens, not only misunsibility,
derstands the argument, but does
violence to the meaning of προσφιλ. 9. τοῦ κατὰ τὸν ἆ. νοουμ.] ’than
our Lord regarded as ’ lit. ’than
Him who is considered according
to the ’ i.e. the man that is in
Him. It is another instance of that
inexact language by which some
fathers speak of ’the God ’ and ’the
Man’ in Christ, meaning the Goddue
head and the Manhood. Cp. just
below the contrast between ὁ Λόγος
and ὁ ὁρώμενος. 10. τί γάρ τὸ θαυμαστόν] See
Westcott’s note in loc. 8. He is our Saviour's God, beme
cause of our Saviour ’s humanity.

as Word, but as Word Incarnate.
Tοῦ δρῷμ’. is masc. 14. τοῦ κ. θεοῦ θεός] He ἲς τοῦ
κυρίως θεοῦ θεός : not however in
virtue of the ’s Godhead, but
because ὁ κυρίως θεός is also man.  Πέμπτον λεγέσθω τὸ λαμβάνειν αὐτὸν ζωήν, ἢ 8. 3 εχει] εχον c || θεος] + ο θεος e2 || 6 ηνικα] + ἀν b 2. ἐπ’ ἀμφοῖν] In regard to both
natures in Christ a term is properly
applied and a term improperly.
The same is true with regard to us;
one term is properly applied in
regard to us and the other improperly:
but the term properly applied
in regard to Christ is applied improperly
in regard to us, and vice uversa.
The term God (in θεός μου καὶ θ.
ὑμῶν) is improperly applied in regard
to Christ as God, and properly in
regard to Christ as man and to us.
The term Father is properly applied
to Christ as God, and improperly to
Christ as man and to us. 5. ἡ τῶν ὀν. ἐπίζευξις] The
communicatio idiomatum. Gr. is
not thinking only of the particular
text, or of the words ‘God’ and
‘Father.’ 7. ταῖς ἐπινοίαις] Cp. iii 13,
which shews that ταῖς ἐπ. is to be
taken with συνδ., not with διιστ.
‘When the natures are mentioned
separately, the nomenclature follows
the distinction of the sense.’ 8. ἵνα ὁ θεός] Eph. i 17. 9. X. μὲν θεός, τῆς δὲ δ. π.] An
interpretation as uncritical as it is
doctrinally precarious. It rests upon
the assumption that δόξα is the offspring
in respect of which the Father
is Father, and not (as in 1 Cor. ii 8,
Jam. ii 1, 1 Pet. iv 14) an epithet;
and the contrast which it draws
between the personal name of the
Incarnate Lord, and the ‘glory’
which is assumed to be His Divine
Nature, is unsound. 11. οὐ τῇ φύσει] So Gr. rejects
the yet unborn heresy of Eutyches.
It might, however, have been still
better if he had said τὸ συναμφ. εἷς.
The ἕν, of course, means ‘a single
whole.’ 9. No. 5.—Life, power, etc. are
given to Him. This too is because
He is Man. But it would be equally
true of Him as God; it does not
imply that these are given Him at
some point subsequent to His eternal
generation. 13. λεγέσθω] ‘be counted’ = ἀρίθμει

not, cannot naturally though

gen. is due to the technical language
of logic, like ἀδυνάτων in § 7. ’Can’
and ’cannot’ do not belong to that
logical class of words which can only
be used in one sense. They have
manyshades of signification πολύς.).

and not ’the ’ At
the same time the argument would
fail if the spoken word by which we
are cleansed were not identified with
the Eternal Word who by means of
it ἐνδημεῖ with us. 5. μὴ δ. ἐκεῖ σ. ποιῆσαι] Mark
vi 5, Matt, xiii 58. 9. οὐκ ἐνεδέχετο κτλ.] ‘ it was
sc. θεραπεύειν, or ἰᾶσθαι,
‘when one of the two failed its fellow?
lit. ‘when the fellow failed the other?
Ἐλλείπειν is a trans, verb. Gr.
probably means that it was a case
of ἀβούλητον on both sides ; the
people ’would’ not take the means
to be healed, and the Lord ’would ’
not heal in spite of them. 10. τῷ εὐλόγῳ added to the examples
of ἀδύνατον = οὐκ εὔλογον
above. 11. τοῦ αὐτοῦ] sc. τοῦ ἀβουλήτου. 12. μὴ μισεῖν ὒ.] John vii 7. Gr.
no doubt was confusing this passage
with John xv 18 f. I know of no
authority for omitting the μή in our
text of Gr. 13. πῶς δύνασθε ἂγ. λ.] Matt, xii
34. 14. ἐστι δέ τι] ‘ There is also a

what is unthinkable, α logical

He does not see the Father act and
then imitate His action, making for
example α world apiece. His action
is not similar, but identical, to that
of the Father, only the initiative
rests with the Father. The sustaining
of what is already created is α
part of this common action of Father
and Son. 2. ἀνεπίδεκτον] ‘ inadmissible ’ or
‘ unthinkable ’ ; almost ’ impossible
in the sense of unthinkable.’ 3. ἢ μὴ εἶναι] ‘ or not to exist.’ ib. τοῦτο γὰρ ἀδυναμίας ἂν εἴη]
See Petavius de Deo Deique Propr.
v 7, and the passages there cited. 7. πάντα γὰρ δσα] John xvi 15. 8. ὡς ξμπαλιν κτλ.] John xvii 10. 9. αὐτὸ τὸ elvai κοινόν] ’ Their
very being is common and equal,
although the Son has it from the
Father.’ 10. ἐγὼ ζῶ δ. τ. π. ] John vi 57. 12. συνεχομνοο] ‘ kept from ’
It seems a slight difficulty
that in John vi 57 our Lord seems
to refer not so much to the origination
of His being as to something
which may be compared to the
continual sustenance of life καὶ ὁ
τρώγων με κἀκεῖνος ζήσει δι’ ἐμέ).
But on the other hand, so far as
we know, the distinction between
the original gift and the maintenance
of life does not exist in the case of
the Eternal Son, but belongs only
to temporal existence. With Him
nasci and pasci are the same. On
the whole this interpretation is better
than to translate συνεχ. ’restricted,’
‘confined.’ 12 ὑπάρχ. ἀχρόνως] instead of
being sustained by a succession of
temporal acts. 13 καὶ ἀναιτίως] It is difficult to
assign a meaning to the word in
this connexion. Gr. has frequently
affirmed that the Father is the αἰτία
of the Son. It must therefore
mean ‘ without any intermediate
or secondary cause.’ ib. βλέπει δὲ...πῶς λ́τλ.] ‘ In

already allowed the identification of
Wisdom with Christ, ἑ 2. 6. ἀντὶ τοῦ παρόντος] 'corresponding
to the present one.’ 13. ἐπὶ τίνος] like ἐπὶ πάντων, ἐφ’
ἑκάστων ; ‘ on what occasion, and at
what time?’ 14. τῶν αὐτ’. πραγμάτων] There
are not two sets of things ; they are
the selfsame things which are done
or made by the Father and the Son,
the Father indicating the form and
the Son giving it expression. 16. ἀμαθῶς] ’ unintclli gently 1 like
one who copies a pattern mechani-
cally. The adverbs are arranged in
a chiasm. ib. οἰκ. εἰπεῖν, πατρ] ‘ to speak

the same manner ἃς the Father? 18. ὁμοίως ποιεῖν] John v 19. 20. ἕως ἄρτι] John v 17.  Ἕβδομον λεγέσθω τὸ καταβεβηκέναι ἐκ τοῦ

grammatical construction for these
words is to attach them to κατὰ τὴν
τ. ἐ. ὁμοτιμίαν, treating καὶ τοῦτο
ἂν εἴη κτλ. as parenthetical. Τῆς
ἐξουσίας will then be not merely ‘of
power,’ but ‘of the power’ displayed
in the making of τὰ γινόμενα :—for
it is clear that Gr. understands
ποιεῖν here chiefly of ‘making’
rather than ‘doing.’ He then adds
that it is not only in respect of
equality of power in creating that
the Son is said to make or do ‘like
wise’ whatever the Father makes or
does, but in respect also of ordering
and sustaining what He has made
or done. 2. ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς ἁ . . . . πν.] Ps. ciii
(civ) 4. Cp. what he has said on
this text ii 31. The point is that
the present is used, where the past
would have been expected. The
power which first made the angels
spirits is still said to make them so. 3. θεμελιοῦσθαι] Ps. ciii (civ) 5,
where Gr. evidently read the present,
ὁ θεμελιῶν. Ἡδρασμένα in ref. to
the earth, γενόμενα in ref. to the
angels. 4. στ. βροντήν] Am. iv 13.
Here the point seems to lie not
only in the tense, but in the using,
with regard to transient things like
thunder and wind, such words as
στερεοῦν, κτίζειν (to found). The
explanation is that the ‘law’ or
‘principle’ of them (λόγος) was laid
down once for all, though the activity
which produces them
continues. 12. No. 7.—I came down not
to do Mine own will, but the will
of Him that sent Me. At first it
looks as if this were said of the Manhood;
for the human will does not
always find it easy to conform to
the divine. The cry in Gethsemane
is a proof of it. But as it was only
the divine nature which came down ,
the will cannot be the human will.
Well, sentences of this kind do not
always imply the existence of the
thing whose activity is denied, but
quite the opposite. The Son has no
will of His own to do, apart from
the Father’s. 7. καταβεβηκέναι] John vi 38. 9. τοῦ κατεληλ. αὐτοῦ] neut.; sec
below, τὸ κατεληλυθός. 10. ὡς παρὰ τοῦ ἁ.] ‘that the expression
took this form as proceeding
from the Man (see note on § 7), not
from the Saviour regarded αἰ such.’ 12. 7 ἀνθρωπίνου] κου b || 11 του υἱοῦ abf || 13 τοιοῦτο συναγομενον b 1. ἐκείνου] sc. τοῦ κατὰ τὸν σ.
νοουμένου. ib. οὐδε ὑπεν.] not opposed to God,
however faintly? The ὑπὸ has its
full significance. ib. θεωθὲν ὅλον] It is strange
that Gr. should allow himself to
speak of the will of the Divine Son
as having been ’ deified ’ (or ’ taken
possession of by ’), which might
imply that except for some action
of God upon it, the ’s will was
not divine. It does not wholly
remove the difficulty to say that the
’time ’ when that action took place
is, like the ’generation’ of which
it is one aspect, before and above
time. 2, τοῦ καθ’ ἡμᾶς] sc νοουμένου ;
‘considered according to us ’ means
‘considered as man.’ 3. ἀντιπίπτοντος] The human
will of Christ, ace. to no was no
exception to the rule; though, as
his next quotation shews, it ceased
to struggle when it was assured
what ’s will was. 5. πάτερ, εἰ δὺν.] Matt, xxvi 39 ;
Luke xxii 42. 8. ἐκεῖνον] i.e. τὸν κατὰ τὸν
σωτῆρα νοούμενον. 9. παρὰ τοῦ προσλαβόντος] the
Divine Son, as opp. to τὸ πρόσλῆμμα,
the nature which He assumed.
‘Ο λόγος is John vi 38, not
the cry in the Garden. 11. οὐχ ὡς ὄντος] ’it does not
imply that the Son has a will of His
own, distinct from the ’s, but
that He has not.’ 13. τὸ συναγόμενον] the meaning
gathered from the words. 16. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ λέγ.] From the
illustrations which Gr. proceeds to
give, it seems clear that the phrase
ἀπὸ κ. is used without any ref. to
τὸ κοινόν immediately before. With
the possible exception of the first,
they have nothing to do with the
peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists
between the Father and the Son.
We must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression
with a wider meaning. It is, however,
difficult to seize the exact
force of it. Elias appears to have
thought that it meant ’ in α way
that common intelligence discerns.'
It prob. means ’in a general way,'
as distinguished from a pedantic
adaptation to special situations.
Cp. κατὰ κοινοῦ § 13. 1 λέγονται b || 3 πάρα θεοῦ θέω ab || 9 om ειτουν ἀποκαταστάσεως cfg 1. καἰ οὐ θετικῶς] This is added
to bear out the assertion οὐχ ὡς
ὄντος, ἀλλ’ ὡς οὐκ ὄντος. The point
lies in this, that while the sentence,
rigidly analysed, implies the existence
of a fact, though it rejects an
inference drawn from the fact, the
speaker’s intention is to deny the
fact as well as the inference. Thus
οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου κτλ. implies that
the Spirit is ‘given,’ though not
‘by by measure ’ ; but in reality it
does not affirm the giving, any
more than the measuring. Again,
οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτία μου κτλ. implies
that the Psalmist was guilty of sin,
though that guilt was not the cause
of the opposition which he en-
countered ; but the Psalmist has no
intention of affirming his own sin.
Again, οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’. implies
that we have righteousnesses, though
we claim nothing on the ground of
them ; but St Paul would never
admit that we have any. Similarly,
’not Mine own will, but Thine’
implies the existence of a will of the
Son, apart from the ’s ; but
if we consider the expression ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ, in a broad way, in view of
the common use of language, we see
that no assertion of the kind is
intended. ib. οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου] John iii
34. In the explanatory sentence
θεός and θεῷ make equally good
sense. Gr. prob. understood the
text as the A.V. does, supplying
’unto Him.' But pern, the very
fact that this was the common intgerpretation
caused θεός to be changed
into θεῷ. 4. οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτί] Ps. lviii 4
(lix 3). 5. οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’.] Α combination
of Dan. ix 18 with Tit.
iii 5. 7. δῆλον δὲ τοῦτο] Gr. returns
to the discussion of John vi 38 foil. 9. eh οὑν ἀποκατ.] Gr. adds this
gloss, because in one sense unbelievers
also have an ἀνάστασις.  Ὅγδοόν ἐστιν αὐτοῖς τό· Ἵνα γινώσκωσι σὲ τὸν
μόνον ἀληθινὸν θεόν, καὶ ὃν ἀπέστειλας Ἰησοῦν χριστόν· 1 om τὸ a ΙΙ 5 νοης] διανοῇς cf: νόεις d ΙΙ νογσεις] νόεις d ’Or. 1’
13. 15 ἀοράτῳ] + καὶ f || 18 πὼς δάι d 1. τὸν λόγον τὸν ἅκ.] John xiv
24. The ἐπεὶ carries us somewhat
abruptly back to the main thesis of
the section, οὐχ ὡς ὄντος κτλ. 6. καὶ παντὸς τοῦ εὐγν] sc. ὁ
λόγος. This is the usual interpretation
of the fathers. 13. ’λθ’. 8. — Thee the only true
God and Jesus Christ, and There is
none good but one, that is, God.
There are other instances where
similar language does not exclude
the Son. Here, it is used to exclude
the false gods, and it is the common
Godhead of the Father and of the
which is addressed as the only
true God. The other text is an
answer to one who, thinking Him to
be only a man, called Him ‘good’;
whereas the goodness was that of the
Godhead. If this argument does not
satisfy them., we can find them a
text which, on their principles, would
prove the Son alone to be God. 8. ἵνα γινώσκωσι σέ] John xvii 3. 10. οὐδεὶς ἀγαθός] Mark x 18. 12. τὴν αὐτοαλήθειαν] viz. Christ,

the Son to death, to darkness
and He must go.’ 18. οὐκ ἀπολεῑ] ‘How can He

the words " only true" were used to

ἀπὸ κοινοῦ in § 12, ‘ in general.' Of
course τῆς θεότ. depends upon ἢν,
not upon κατὰ κ. Gr. does not perceive
what difficulties he is landed
in, if he makes ’Jesus Christ' address
the Godhead in general as
His sender. Both Nestorianism and
Sabellianism are near at hand.
ἀπάντησιν ἔχει πρός] ‘is intended

confused the Rich Young Ruler

perhaps more strictly νικήσειε is impersonal,
and λέγεσθαι in app. to
imaginary subject, ’ if it should
that,' etc. 5. ἡττήμεθα] The weapons that
were forged against the Son, when
the text from John xvii 3 was under
discussion, beat the Father off the
field (Gr. purposely uses an outrageous
word), when we treat other
texts on the same principle. The
1st pers. is used because ex hypothesi
Gr. has been converted (νικήσειε) to
the view which he opposes. 14. No. 9. — To make intercession

sion in general) does not

element in ἐκδίκησιν ζητεῖν which
Gr. pts away, but the thought of
appealing to a supreme power
against a foe too strong for the
appellant. ‘There would,' he
’be something even of abasement in
that.’ 12. πρεσβεύειν ὑπ’. ἡμ.] ’to act

The explanatory clause, τὰ σάρκ’.
λέγω π., shews that Gr. is not here
concerned with our knowledge, but
only with ’s condition : γινώσκηται,
but for the text of 2 Cor.,
might as well be ἦ. 3. χ. τῆς ἁμαρτίας] Heb. iv 15. 4. καὶ παράκλητον] 1 John ii 1.
The καὶ does not indicate a new

words these are. 8. ἢ. . . δίκαιον] The ἢ grammatically
joins δίκαιον to the adjectival
notion in τοῦ πατρός, τοῦ υἱοῦ. 9. ἀλλ’ οἶς πονθεν] ‘ But on
the strength of what He has suffered
in His character of Man, He prevails
upon us to endure in His character
of the Word and the Encourager.’
Thus Gr. seems to recognise only
the manward aspect of the work of
the Advocate. 15. No. 10 — The Son knoweth
not the last day or hour. Obviously
the Wisdom through whom the
worlds, or ages, were made cannot
be ignorant of the length of their
duration ; and our Saviour's s prophecies
concerning the last things
shetv that He knew. You cannot
know how the day ends without
knowing how the night begins. He
knew therefore as God, and knew
not as man. The title of the Son,
standing by itself, lends itself to this
supposition. 12. μηδένα γινώσκειν] Mark xiii

In συντελεστὴς Gr. peril, refen
to sach passages as Epb. i 10, or

(although the Speaker there is the
Father) or Wisd. vii 27 ; in τὸ
πέρας, to Rev. i 17 etc., or Col. i
16 εἰς αὐτόν). The question only
asks how such an one could be
ignorant of anything ; but the titles
by which He is here spoken of have
ref. to this particular thing. 1 τὰ] μέτα b || 2 τὰ ἐν ἀυτῶ] τὸ ἐν ἀυτῶ be ’Or. I ’ || 3 ’δε] δάι d ||

11. St Paul is speaking of the
Spirit, not of the Son. 4. ἀκριβῶς ἐπίσταται] as shewn,
no doubt, by His prophecies. ib. ἐν χρῷ] This seems to have
been the reading of Elias ; and it is
found in the second hand of the
Lincoln College MS. The expression
is both idiomatic and forcible, to
denote what happens right up to
the very moment of the end ; and,
as Jahn points out, in his notes on
Elias, the word οἶον would go more
naturally with it than with the tamer
ἐν χρόνῳ. The reading ἐν χρόνῳ may
easily be attributed to an early
copyist unfamiliar with the phrase
ἐν χρῷ, wno thought it an abbreviation
for ἐν χρόνῳ. 9. συνεισάγει] ‘implies,’ ‘involves’;
cp. iii 16. 11. τὸ φαῖν’. χωρίσῃ τοῦ ν.] τὸ
νοούμενον may so naturally be used
in contrast with τὸ φαῖν’., as ’the
unseen' to ’the seen,' that probably
Gr. must be understood to mean by
the first the Lord's human nature,
and by τὸ νοούμ. the divine. So
Elias takes it. But it might be
possible to take τὸ φ. = ‘ the look ’
of the saying, and τὸ νοούμ. = ‘ the
meaning? Α casual reader, looking
only at τὸ φ., would think that an
absolute ignorance was predicated ;
but attentive examination would
shew that that is not τὸ νοούμενον. 12. τὸ γὰρ ἀπόλυτον κτλ.] The
γὰρ justifies the assertion εὔδηλον.
‘ For the fact that the title of " the
Son " stands absolutely and without
conditions, nothing being added to
say whose Son, suggests to us this
interpretation ; so that we put the
more reveiwit construction tipon the
ignorance, and attribute it to the
human nature, not to the divine.'
Ἄσχετον is used in a remarkable
way, as if from σχέσις, ‘ ’
In the light of later criticism, the
fact which Gr. notices may be
thought to tell in the opp. direction
: the absolute title seems to
denote the eternal relation, not the
temporary condition. See ’s
note in his St Mark p. 297. Gr. takes
the argument, as well as the illustrations
of τεῖχος, νύξ, from Ath. οἱ. iii
c. Ar. § 43, who says that if it had
stood ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, it would have
implied that the Godhead did not
know, but that ὁ υἱός allows us to
suppose that the ignorance is that

to refer this knowledge, like everything
else which the Son possesses,
to its absolute source in the Father.
All expressions about His obedience
and the cost of it evidently apply
only to the nature which He assumed.
We pass to the consideration of His
many titles. 8. ἐπὶ τὴν αἰτίαν] ’ referred back
to the primary Cause? i.e. the Father.
ther. This has already been done
in the case of the Son's power ;
it holds good of ’everything else'
which the Son possesses ; they are
not His, but the Father's, inasmuch
as the Father alone is the source
of them. So it may be, Gr. says.
with our Lord's knowledge of great
matters. 10. τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς φ. τις] He
means Basil, who tells Amphilochius
(Epist. ccxxxvi) that this was the
interpretation which he had heard
ἐκ παιδὸς παρὰ τῶν πατέρων. The
same is found in the Disp. c. Arium
printed with the works of Athanasius
§ 27). ib. μικρὸν ἐννοῆσαι] ‘ would see to
some extent.' The observation holds
true, even if we do not accept Basil's
account of the particular passage
μηδὲ ἐκείνως ἀναγνούς). 11. ἢ ὡς δ́τι ö π.] ’ except in so far
as He does so because the Father
does.’ 12. τὸ συναγόμενον] Cp. § 12.
The rgument is not very clear ;
but the ὡς δῆλον appears to give the
reason, not for the Son's knowing,
but for the Son's knowing it from
the Father. Nothing but the πρώτη
φύσις can know, therefore the incarnate
Son could not obtain the
knowledge in any other way than
from the Father.  Ἀρκτέον δὲ ἡμῖν ἐντεῦθεν. τὸ θεῖον ἀκατονόμαστον· 5 υπακοην] + και cdg || 9 ου] + περι dfg || 11 τοσουτον] τοσουτος d || 16 περι

cannot be named. The reticence of
the Hebrews testifies to this. No
name that we can give can express
all that God is. 19. ἀκατονόμαστον] ‘can have no
name.’ 21. ὅσον εἰκ. ἔδοσαν] We are not
directly informed what was the original
purpose of the custom to which
Gr. is about to refer ; we can only
conjecture.  Ὅσον δ’ οὖν ἐκ τῶν ἡμῖν ἐφικτῶν, ὁ μὲν ὤν, καὶ 17, 1 ἔδοσαν] ἔδωκαν f || 6 πώποτε ὀλὸν f || 7 παντελῶς θεοῦ eg ||

special and peculiar characters.'
Gr.'s account of the matter
somewhat confused. While it is
well known that the Jews never
pronounced the name, there seems
to be no ground for saying that it
was written in a peculiar script. 3. ἀκοινώνητον] ‘ not right that
God should be put on a level
us. ’ 5. λυομένη] Cp. ii 13. The
sound is uttered and melts away
and perishes ; it is therefore unsuitable
for expressing the indissoluble,
imperishable nature of God. 6. ἰδιάζουσαν] This epithet is
added in a not strictly logical position.
The fact that God's nature
is unique is no reason why it should
not be expressed in fleeting sounds.
The word is added in ref. to the
custom mentioned, of using a special
character. 8. περὶ αὐτόν] contrasted with
κατ’ αὐτόν. For Gr.'s use of περί
with ace. see iii 10, 12. Certain
facts in connexion with God are
known to us, and from these we
dimly and tentatively draw for ourselves
pictures of what He actually is. 9. ἄλλην ἀπ’ ἄλλου] We put our
mental image together, deriving
part of it from one quarter, part
from another. 11. ὁ δεσμός] Elias is, no doubt,
right in understanding the bond
which binds the soul to the body.
Cp. iii 8. 12. φαντασθῇ πλόον] Cp. ii 17. 13. ἴνδαλμα] Cp. ii 20. 18. Two names come neatest to

Lord also, is after all a relative
term, I AM is a less inadequate
name, because it is positive and absolute. 15. ἐκ τῶν ἡμ. ἐφικτῶν] sc. ὀνομάτων. 18, 3 η] ει ’unus Reg.' || 11 ἀυτὴ] αὕτη ac || 12 μου] μοι b ‘ Reg.

Cp. κυρίως in iii 14. 6. ἀπὸ τοῦ θ. ἢ αἴθ’.] The first
is ’s etymology (Crat. 397 c).
It is not known whence Gr. took
the second. The tract de Definitionibus,
printed among the works
of Athanasius from which it is
quoted by Suicer, is of later date. 8. δαπανητικόν] Cp. § 6. ib. πῦρ καταναλ.] Heb. xii 29 ;
Deut. iv 24. 9. ἀλλ’ οὖν τῶν πρός τι λ. ἑ.] ’ is
nevertheless a relative word, not
absolute one.' Cp. iii 12. 11. ἐγὼγάρ...ὄνομα] Α combination
of Ex. xx 2 and Is. xlii 8. 12. κύριος ὄν. αὐτῷ] Ex. xv 3. 13. φύσιν ἐπιζ. κτλ.] ‘are in
quest of a nature (i.e. of a
which will properly denote a nature) ;
and a nature is a thing
dependent upon connexion with something
else.' Gr. does not in these
words mean to describe a property
which distinguishes the divine nature
from others. It is a common
property of all natures. ‘Man,’ for
ex., is not the name of a relationship,
but of a substantive thing ;
while ’husband,’ ’slave,’ 'Cappadocian, ’
which express a relationship,
are not the names of a nature. 14. ἴδιον ὄντως θεοῦ] so ἐστίν.
What we are in quest of, we find in
the name ὁ ὤν ; for τὸ ὂν is the
special property of God, and belongs
to Him in its entirety, not partially,
as it does to other beings, who only
have a share in existence. It is a
little surprising that Gr. does not
say τὸ δὲ εἶναι, instead of τὸ δὲ ὄν.
Perhaps it is because he has used τὸ
εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat
different sense (viz. of what a
thing is, rather than that it is) ; and
whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence
as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν
represents it as actually existing,
and so is better suited to denote the
fulness of the divine nature.  τῶν δ’ ἄλλων προσηγοριῶν αἱ μὲν τῆς ἐξουσίας

of the verb is illustrated by the
subst. περικοπή, a passage in a
book with its beginning and ending
marked. 19. Other titles signify His
power, like Almighty, King, Lord ;
others belong to His revelation of
Himself in history, such as God of
vengeance, of salvation, of righteousness.
All these are common to the
Three Persons, each of whom has
His special appellation. Those of
the Son arc as follows. 4. οἰκονομίας] Cp. iii 18. They
are ’dispensational’ names, whether
proper to the ’dispensation’ of the
Incarnation, or independent of it. 5. οἶον ὁ μὲν π.] Titles of ἐξουσία:
‘ the Almighty, and King, —
whether οφ Glory, or θ’ etc. Παντοκράτωρ,
as is evident from the
context, is correctly used as=
’Master of all.’ 6. τῆς δόξης] Ps. xxiii (xxiv) 7. ib. τῶν αἰώνων] 1 Tim. i 17 (cp.
Tobit xiii 6, 10). 7. τῶν δὺν. τοῦ ἀγαπ.] Ps. lxvii
13 (lxviii 12) ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν δυνάμενων
του ἀγαπητοῦ, του ἂγἀπῃτοῦ.
The reading ἢ τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ in the
mss. of Gr. may be a trace of a
longer reading τῶν δυνάμεων τοῦ
ἀγαπητοῦ, ἢ τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ, which
would treat the second τοῦ ἂγ. in
the Ps. as parallel to τῶν δὺν., not
to the first τοῦ ἂγ. ib. τῶν βασιλ.] 1 Tim. vi 15. 8. ὀ κύριος, ἢ σαβαώθ] ’and the
Lord, of Sabaoth, i.e. of Hosts, or
of etc. Σαβαώθ is used about fifty
times in Isaiah (LXX.), four times
in 1 Kings (1 Sam.), and once in
Zech.; cp. Rom. ix 29, James v 4. ib. ἢ τῶν δὺν.] Ps. xxiii (xxiv)
10. The art. shews that Gr. is not
offering δὺν. as an alternative translation
of σαβαώθ, but as a fresh
title, depending directly upon κύριος.
Needless to say that κ. τ. δὺν. (and
παντοκράτωρ) represent the same
Heb. as κ. σαβαώθ. 9. τῶν κυρ.] 1 Tim. vi 15. 10. ὁ δὲ θεός, ἢ τοῦ σ.] Ps. lxvii
21 (lxviii 20). These are titles of
‘dispensation.’ ib, ἐκοδικήσεων] Ps. xciii (xciv) 1. ib. εἰρήνης] Rom. xv 33 etc. 11. δικαιοσύνης] Mai. ii 17, cp.

36 (lxviii 8, 35). The epithets are
Gr.'s own addition, intended to interpret
the phrase. Ὁρῶντος θεόν
seems to be introduced in ref. to
the circumstances in which Jacob’s
name was changed (Gen. xxxii 30). 2. τρισὶ τούτοις] The three things
are (1) fear of punishment, (2) hope
of salvation and of glory, (3) practice
of virtues. It might seem a more
logical classification to make the
third the ‘hope of glory,’ the ‘practice
of virtues’ being added to shew
how the motives which Gr. has
mentioned act. But this is forbidden
by the τὸ δὲ τῶν ἀρετῶν
below. Διοικούμεθα therefore is
used in a somewhat different sense
with ἀσκήσει from what it is with
δέει and ἐλπίδι. We are governed
by two great prevailing motives,
and on one great moral principle. 4. ἀσκ. τῶν ἀρ. ἐξ ὧν τ.] ‘the
practice of the virtues which result
in these.’ Ταῦτα sc. σωτηρία and
δόξα. 5. τῶν σωτηρίων] Ps. xxvii
(xxviii) 8, lxvii 20 (lxviii 19), lxxxiv
5 (lxxxv 4). It is prob. the plur.
of σωτήριον, and not to be written
σωτηριῶν. 6. τῶν ἀρετῶν] sc. δικαιοσύνης,
εἰρήνης. ib. ἵν᾿ ὡς τὸν θεόν κτλ.] Α comparison
of what is said of Enos in
ii 18 would suggest that τούτων τι
means the φόβος and the ἐλπίς. Α
man who carries within him the
presence of the God of vengeance
and of salvation, and thus attains
to some measure of fear and hope,
is spurred on to seek moral perfection
and the kinship with God which
comes of it. This gives more point
to the sentence than if ἄσκησις itself
is included in τούτων τι. 8. οἰκείωσιν] Cp. ii 17 τῷ οἰκείῳ. 9. ἔτι] ‘so far.’ 13. ὡρμήθη λέγειν] ‘meant at the
outset to say.’ Cp. ii 11. 20. He is the Son, Only begotten,
Word, Wisdom, Power, Truth,
Image, Light, Life, Righteousness,
Sanctification, Redemption,
Resurrection. 20, 2 μονον] μόνος e2 || 13 συνέστηκεν] συνέστη καὶ c 1. ἐκεῖνο] sc. ὄπερ ὁ πατήρ. Kἀκεῖθεν,
sc. ἐκ τοῦ πατρός. ib. μόνον] ’nothing but a Son.'
Cp. iii 5. 3. μονοτρόπως] ‘by a single process,’
as distinguished from corporeal
births, to which various processes
contribute through a long space of
time. Cp. iii 4. 4. πρὸς νοῦν λόγος] ‘ His relation
to the Father is that of word to
mind.’ ib. διὰ τὸ ἀπαθές] i.e. to indicate
that when He is called Son, there
is nothing of ‘ passion ’ in His generation.
The title of ’Word’ does
more than this; it indicates the
abiding connexion between the
Word and God, — for mind and
word are inseparable, — and also the
fact that He gives expression to the
mind of God. 6. ὄρος] ‘definition, for λόγος is
used in this sense also.'

of ’law’ or principle; as in

it occurs in conjunction with σοφία. 17. ἀλήθεια] John xiv 6. 19. σφραγίς] Cp. iii 17. 20. χαρακτῆρι Heb. i 3. ib. εἰκών] 2 Cor. iv 4, Col. i 15. 3 ἀκίνητος κινουμένου ἐνταῦθα] ἀκινήτως νοουμένου ἔκει b || 7 τω μεν...τω

perh. by ’Attic attraction,' ‘and of
the thing which it is called.’ 3. ἐκεῖ] in the case of the material
image; ἐνταῦθα, in the case of
the Son. Κινουμένου suggests that
Gr. understood εἰκών to apply only
to pictures or effigies of persons. 5. τὸ ἀπαράλλακτον] Παραλλαγή
would express the slight variations
that occur in all cases of human
copying, or in the course of generations.
There is ‘ less ’ of such
variation in the ’s representation
of His Father, than there was when
Adam begat Seth κατὰ τὴν ἰδέαν
αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ
(Gen. v 3). By ’less’ Gr. of course
means that there is none. 6. τῶν ἁπλῶν] such as God’s. 7. τῷ μέν...τῷ δέ] not here the
dative of comparison, but kin this
particular, and in that.’ 8. ταὐτὸν μ. ἢ ἀφομ.] ’ identical
rather than like.’ 9. φῶς] John i 9 etc. ib. λόγῳ] Gr. seems to mean
rather the reasoning mind, which
takes account of truth, than speech;
’ cleansed in mind and life. ’ This
is shewn by the parallels ἄγνοια,
γνῶσις, which follow. 11. ζωή] John xi 25 etc. He is
Life, just because, as has been
shewn, He is Light. 12. οὐσί ὦσις] ’ the giving of being. ’
He is that by virtue of which all
reasonable creatures have permanence
and substantive existence. ib. ἐν αὐτῷ γάρ] Acts xvii 28.
The words are not said of the Son. 14. καὶ πνοήν...καὶ πν.ἅγ.] Gen.
ii 7, John xx 22. Ἐκεῖθεν in the
same way as at the beginning of
the § All of us have received from
Him the ‘ breath of life ’ ; as many
as are capable of it have received
the Holy Spirit, in measure proportioned
to our receptivity.  ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἔτι κοινὰ τοῦ τε ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς καἰ 4 τὸ μὲν . ..το δε] τὼ μεν...τω ’δε f || 10 ἀπανιστὰς ἧμας ace || απανιστας]

131. Cp. ii 6. ib. δικαιοσύνη] 1 Cor. i 30. Gr.
does not see in the passage any ref.
to justification. Christ is ‘righteousness’
inasmuch as He awards
in all cases what is meet and right.
As examples of such award, He
mentions the judging justly between
those under the law and those under
grace, and between soul and body.
Διαιτᾷν with the dat. is 'to arbitrate
for or between.' By arbitrating between
those under law and grace
respectively, Gr. prob. meant that
in the final settlement of rewards
and punishments account will be
taken of the opportunities which
each man has enjoyed in life. 3. ψυχῇ κ. σώματι] Cp. i 7. 6. ἁγιασμός] 1 Cor. i 30. As
being Himself all purity, lie cannot
but sanctify those to whom He
comes, in order that that which is
pure, i.e. the revelation of God,
may be received by purity, i.e. by
souls which are characterized by it. 7. ἀπολύτρωσις] 1 Cor. i 30. 9. λύτρον] Mark x 45 ; cp. 1 Tim.
ii 6. ib. τῆς οἰκ. καθ’] ‘ sufficient to
cleanse the world.’ 10. ἀνάστασις] John xi 25. Ἐντεῦθεν
= from this world.' Gr. does
not seem to intend ἐντ’. ἤμ’. ἀπανιστάς
to refer to the bodily resurrection.
but to the spiritual and
moral resurrection of which the next
clause speaks. 21. The foregoing belong to Him
both as God and as Man ; the following
belong to Him as incarnate:—
Man, Son of Man, Christ, Way,
Door, Shepherd, Sheep, Lamb, High
Priest, Melchizedck. He must be-
thought ὁ ἃς God and Man, — as
God unchanged in assuming the
manhood. 12. ἔτι] as in § 19; ‘ thus far.’ ib. τοῦ τε ὑπὲρ ἡμ.] It would
be quite in keeping with Gr.'s usage
to make the τοῦ masc., ’Him who is
above us and Him who came to be
what He is for our sakes'; cp. § 7.
But perhaps we may give Gr. the
benefit of the doubt and take the
word as neut., as it is below. 21. 1 δι’ ἧμας] καθ’ ἧμας ’Reg. Cypr.' || 6 τὼ κατακριθὲν a || 8 οσων]

and yet not by, the law of birth (or
genration)' ; as born by natural
descent from Adam, and by natural
birth from His Mother, though His
conception was miraculous. 15, χρίσις γὰρ αὕτη] repeated
from § 2. ib. οὐκ ἐνεργείᾳ] Ιν the case of
other ’ anointed ’ ones the Godhead
sanctifies them by exerting energy
upon them ; but in the case of
Christ’s humanity the sanctification
was due to the indwelling of the
entire power which sanctifies. The
effect of this is that that anointing
power in Him bears the name of
God, while that which it anoints is
raised to Godhead. In. this statevisible
ment we have the converse of that
inexactness which has been referred
to above. It is not really τὸ χρίον,
strictly speaking, which is called
man, but ὁ χρίων. 16. ὁδός] John xiv 6. 17, θύρα] John x 9. ib. ποιμήν] John x 11. 7 αμνος] αμνον f || 8 μελχ. ’δε] om ’δε e 1. εἰς τ. χλδης...ὀδηγῶν] Ps. xxii

form the subject ; ὁ αὐτὸς πν. is the
predicate. The interpr. which Gr.
has just put upon the title χριστός
must be borne in mind. He seems
to take χθ. κ. σῆμ’ closely together,
in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during
these last few days,' — not, of course,
like πρώην τε καἰ χθές, excluding the
present, but including it. With σωματικῶς
cp. Col. ii 9; the adverbs
have no verbs to qualify, unless ὤν
or ὑπάρχων be supplied. For πνευματικῶς
= νοουμένας see WestCOtt on
Heb. ix 14. The sentence is therefore:
’Jesus, anointed with the whole
indwelling Godhead, who now for a
few days has been in bodily form, is,
considered according to the inward
principle of His being, the same
unchanged personality that He was
before His incarnation, and will be
so for ever.’ 3 αιωνας] + τῶν αἰώνων df
