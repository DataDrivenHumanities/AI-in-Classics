the sacrilegious heretic robs of its
‘meaning.’ 5. σφετερίζονται] ‘take possession

is not free from danger. an ἱερόσυλος

divine person implied in τη θεότητι.
cp. iii 18, 19. it must be remembered

gr. would of course deny that
the godhead of christ was subjected
to suffering, though the divine person
was so subjected, in virtue of
the nature which he assumed.  εστι γὰρ εν μεν αὐτοῖς εκεῖνο καὶ λίαν πρόχειρον

...with a view to his works. we
will not shirk the difficulty by making

it is our lord who speaks. but the
cause which he alleges to have been
in vircv at his creation shews that
he is speaking of the creation of his
manhood, which was created ivith a
view to the works of verity and judgment
in our salvation. when afterwards
he speaks of his godhead,
he uses very different language; he
begetteth me — there is no cause there. 6. λαὶ λίαν πρόκ.] ‘exceedingly

πρὸς δ πως ἀπ’. 7. k. εκτισε με] prov. viii 11.
the heb. word is kanah, not bara

it signifies comparare; and prob.
κτᾶσθαι (which is the rendering of
aquila, symmachus, and theodotion)
is nearer to it than the lxx.
κτίζειν. cp. bas. adv. eun. ii 20.
into that question, however, gr. does
not enter. 9. την τελ. παράπτωσιν] sc.
solomon's. 10. της σοφίας αὐτης] ’of wisdom

person in whom all wisdom is
gathered up and displayed. delitzsch,
commenting on the passage in prov.,
says, "wisdom is not god, but
’s; she has personal existence
in the logos of the n.t., but is not
herself the logos." gr. further explains
this wisdom, to be ’the
science, so to speak, and the artistic
principle ὅκ’ which the universe is
composed.’ gr. intends to
carefully the τεχν. λόγος from the
person of ’the word.’ 13. η θάλασσα. . . η ἄβυσσος] job

prob. refers to basil, who, in the hom.
in princ. proverb. ε 3, where he has
no controversial animus, expounds
very strikingly the ’personification’
of that wisdom which speaks to us
out of nature. very likely other
catholic authors adopted the same
view. bas. himself, however,
when in controversy with the eunomians,
gives the same account as
gr. does here (adv. enn. iv p. 293
ληπτεον οὖν . . . επὶ τοῦ την μορφην
δούλου λαβόντος). that account, it
may be added, is derived from
athanasius, who says (de deer. nic.
syn. p. 220 b), to δε πρόσωπον τοῦ
μεν σωτηρός εστι, τότε δε λεγεται ὅτε
λοιπὸν λαβων τὸ σωμα λεγει κτλ. cp.

ii 3. among other expositors whom
gr. knew, origen (de princ. i 2)
identifies wisdom with the eternal
son, and, though he does not admit
any imaginable period before the
generation of wisdom, thinks that
wisdom speaks of herself as having
been created, inasmuch as she comtains
in herself from the outset the
beginnings and outlines of the creation
that was to be. denys of rome
on the other hand (in ath. de deer.
nic. syn. ρ. 232) dwells upon the
various significations of the word
κτίζειν in the bible, and understands
it here to mean ’appointing,’ ‘setting
over the works which were
made through ’ for another
explanation, with which, however,
gr. was hardly likely to be acquinted,
see nil. de trin. xii 35
foil. 7. η τοῦτο] ‘otherwise this;’
which is the ’cause’ of god, ’would
be prior to god.’ 10. τὸ γεννᾷ με] prov. viii 25. 11. μετὰ της αἰτίας] ‘coupled with
a mention of cause.’ 15. ἀληθεια κ. κρίσις] ps. ex (cxi)
7. these, which are the works of
our salvation τοῦ σωθηναι π. ημᾶς),
are identified as ’the works’ with
view to which wisdom was ‘created.’  τούτω δε επεται καὶ τὸ δοῦλον ἀκούειν εὖ δουλεύοντα

καὶ πάθεσι τοῖς ημετεροις, διὰ την ημετεραν ελευθερίαν,
καὶ πᾶσιν οἷς σεσωκεν ὑπὸ της ἁμαρτίας κατεχομενους. 3. 10 κατεχομενους] -οις f 1. εχρίσθη θεότητι] gr. falls
again into the danger of nestorian
language, and speaks as if there
were a created person (identified
with the created ’wisdom’) who
was ’anointed with godhead.’
mention of unction is so abrupt that
i cannot help suspecting that in
some version accessible to gr. the
word nissachti in prov. viii 23 ἱ
was set ’) was translated ‘ι was
anointed.’ so the heb. word
understood by fiirst, bertheau, and
others; but i know no other indication
of such a rendering in any
ancient version. 4. την κάτω γ.] ‘his birth upon
earth.’ 5. πλόον ἄληπτον] used instead
of ἀληπτοτερα bee. it implies more
decidedly that η κάτω γ. was itself
ἄληπτος. 3. under the same head come the
texts tvhich speak of him ἃς a servant,
vant, and make it a great thing for
him to be called a child of god. his
incarnation did indeed put him in a
state ὁ servitude; and it ὕας indeed
α great thing for his manhood to be
so united to god. 6. εὖ δουλ. πολλοῖς] is. liii 11. 7. μεγα. . . παῖδα θ.] is. xlix 6.
from what follows, it seems that gr.
(and his opponents) understood
παῖδα = τεκνον or υἱόν. 8. εδοὑλ. σαρκί] gr. seems to
be undecided whether to take πολ.
λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λενεσις,
πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν
οἶς κτλ. the ’attic attraction’
οἶς misled de billy into supposing
that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus
illis per quae). it is difficult to
determine whether the same mistake
caused the copyists to write κατεχομενους,
or whether gr. himself
neglected to complete the attraction
by saying (as he should have done)
κατεχομενοις. that ue ’s translation
is wrong is shewn by the
absence of the article before κατεχομενους;
if gr. had meant ’and all
those things whereby he hath saved
those who were enslaved,’ he
have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. in view of
the preponderating authority for
κατεχομενους, it seems best to retain
it in the text, understanding it to be
a construction ad sensum, agreeing
with the οὓς which lies hidden in
the attracted ὄις.  δεύτερον δε τί των μεγίστων αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀμάχων;

gr. prob. forgot the context of the
words, and thought that they were
used in the address of gabriel to
the b.v.m. or some such place.
his meaning here is plainly that the
human nature assumed by the son
of god was thus ’visited.’ 3. τὸ γεννωμενον ἅγ.] luke i 35. 4. χαρισθηναιαὐτω τὸὄ.] phil, ii 9. 6."/> πᾶν γόνυ... τω κενωθεντι] phil.

the word until does not always
negative the extension of the alleged
action beyond the time mentioned.
and besides, christ's reign is two-
fold. it is absolute, even over the
refractory; and it is progressive,
over those who are made willing to
submit, in the first sense it never
ends, in the second it ends with the
completion of the submission. 12. δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν β.] 1 cor. xv

the godhead as α whole. 13. μαθεῖν] heb. v 8 ; cp. vs. 7. 16. δραματουργεῖται] ‘ it ἲς a

elias, ’ applies the name of a drama

not mean that it was unreal and

perly to his eternal and divine self. 17. των). ὒ. χεῖρα τ.] the

as if κἀκεῖνο were but a repetition
of what had already been said in
εργω τιμᾷ τ. ὑπακ. κ. πειρᾶται ταύτης.
the difference is that in the earlier
sentences gr. speaks of us as represented
by christ ; we suffer, as it
were, and obey in him. here he
states the converse truth, that christ
identifies his lot with ours; he
enters into our experiences in order
to know at first hand what obedience
on our part costs. 11. τεχνη φιλανθρ.] by a
which his love of man (tit. iii 4)
suggested. 12. ποσὸν μεν ἀπαιτ.] de billy
translates quantumque et a nobis exigi
et condonari debeat, which gives the
required sense, but is grammatically
impossible. if πόσον be read, the
only possible meaning is that christ
learns by practical experience what
is demanded of us and what allowance
is made for us. this, however,
is unsatisfactory, so far as
συγχωρ. is concerned. it is best to
read ποσόν, and to make ἀπαιτ.,
συγχωρ., independent verbs coordinate
with δοκιμ., μετρεῖ. they thus
express the result of ’s gracious
experiment ; ‘ and a certain
ἲς still made upon us, and a
allowance is now made ὂν us, our
infirmity being taken into account
along with what we have to bear.’ 14. τὸ φως...σκοτίᾳ] john i 5. 4 εκείνου διαφυγ.] κἀκείνου φυγόντος b || καὶ] γε df 1. διὰ τὸ πρόβλημα] ‘ because of

concealed him. the πρόβλημα was
the fleshly nature which christ assumed.
if it had not been for that,
the evil one would not have ventured
to ‘ persecute ’ him. the
thought is a favourite one with gr.

σκότος is more concrete, so to speak,

dependent upon σκοτίας, not in app.

is chosen with ref. to john i 5. although
christ escaped uninjured
from the temptation, it is not wonderful,
gr. says, that we should

tempter but) even to some extent
be ’overtaken.’ the wonder is
that he should even have been
subject to assault, not that we
should fail under it. 7. εν ω γὰρ π.] heb. ii 18. 9. ξσται δε ὁ θ. τὰ π.] 1 cor.

to tke παραφθ. in a deponent
sense, but without authority. 2. ὅλος θεός] god in the most
unrestricted sense. exegetically gr.
is no doubt wrong: ὁ θεός, as usual,
means the father, to whom the son

made subject. but his suggestion
of the way in which the great result
will be brought about is full of
beauty. 3. κινημασι] motions of will, like

best mss. read ὑμ., that reading seems
to a misunderstanding. gr. has
just admitted ὁμολογ. ημεῖς) that
the father is greater than the son
by reason of being his αἰτία. some
one else, he says, of course on the
orthodox side, might find fault with
for the admission, and urge that
in this case no manner of inferiority
attaches to being ’caused’ and not
’cause.’ as gr. has already (iii ii )
made the remark in his own person,
it is only a rhetorical device to
put it here in the mouth of another.
the rendering of de billy, ’
monem nostrum acriori animi conib.

derstands the argument, but does
violence to the meaning of προσφιλ. 9. τοῦ κατὰ τὸν ἆ. νοουμ.] ’than

fathers speak of ’the god ’ and ’the
man’ in christ, meaning the goddue
head and the manhood. cp. just

the same is true with regard to us;

but the term properly applied
in regard to christ is applied improperly
in regard to us, and vice uversa.
the term god (in θεός μου καὶ θ.

the term father is properly applied
to christ as god, and improperly to

doctrinally precarious. it rests upon
the assumption that δόξα is the offspring

jam. ii 1, 1 pet. iv 14) an epithet;
and the contrast which it draws
between the personal name of the
incarnate lord, and the ‘glory’
which is assumed to be his divine
nature, is unsound. 11. οὐ τη φύσει] so gr. rejects

that in john vi 57 our lord seems
to refer not so much to the origination
of his being as to something
which may be compared to the
continual sustenance of life καὶ ὁ
τρωγων με κἀκεῖνος ζησει δι’ εμε).
but on the other hand, so far as
we know, the distinction between
the original gift and the maintenance
of life does not exist in the case of
the eternal son, but belongs only
to temporal existence. with him
nasci and pasci are the same. on
the whole this interpretation is better
than to translate συνεχ. ’restricted,’
‘confined.’ 12 ὑπάρχ. ἀχρόνως] instead of
being sustained by a succession of
temporal acts. 13 καὶ ἀναιτίως] it is difficult to
assign a meaning to the word in
this connexion. gr. has frequently
affirmed that the father is the αἰτία

grammatical construction for these
words is to attach them to κατὰ την
τ. ε. ὁμοτιμίαν, treating καὶ τοῦτο
ἂν εἴη κτλ. as parenthetical. της
εξουσίας will then be not merely ‘of
power,’ but ‘of the power’ displayed
in the making of τὰ γινόμενα :—for
it is clear that gr. understands
ποιεῖν here chiefly of ‘making’
rather than ‘doing.’ he then adds
that it is not only in respect of
equality of power in creating that
the son is said to make or do ‘like
wise’ whatever the father makes or
does, but in respect also of ordering
and sustaining what he has made
or done. 2. ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς ἁ . . . . πν.] ps. ciii
(civ) 4. cp. what he has said on
this text ii 31. the point is that
the present is used, where the past
would have been expected. the
power which first made the angels
spirits is still said to make them so. 3. θεμελιοῦσθαι] ps. ciii (civ) 5,
where gr. evidently read the present,
ὁ θεμελιων. ηδρασμενα in ref. to
the earth, γενόμενα in ref. to the
angels. 4. στ. βροντην] am. iv 13.
here the point seems to lie not
only in the tense, but in the using,
with regard to transient things like
thunder and wind, such words as
στερεοῦν, κτίζειν (to found). the
explanation is that the ‘law’ or
‘principle’ of them (λόγος) was laid
down once for all, though the activity
which produces them
continues. 12. no. 7.—i came down not
to do mine own will, but the will
of him that sent me. at first it
looks as if this were said of the manhood;
for the human will does not
always find it easy to conform to
the divine. the cry in gethsemane
is a proof of it. but as it was only
the divine nature which came down ,
the will cannot be the human will.
well, sentences of this kind do not
always imply the existence of the
thing whose activity is denied, but
quite the opposite. the son has no
will of his own to do, apart from
the father’s. 7. καταβεβηκεναι] john vi 38. 9. τοῦ κατεληλ. αὐτοῦ] neut.; sec
below, τὸ κατεληλυθός. 10. ως παρὰ τοῦ ἁ.] ‘that the expression
took this form as proceeding
from the man (see note on § 7), not
from the saviour regarded αἰ such.’ 12. 7 ἀνθρωπίνου] κου b || 11 του υἱοῦ abf || 13 τοιοῦτο συναγομενον b 1. εκείνου] sc. τοῦ κατὰ τὸν σ.
νοουμενου. ib. οὐδε ὑπεν.] not opposed to god,
however faintly? the ὑπὸ has its
full significance. ib. θεωθεν ὅλον] it is strange
that gr. should allow himself to
speak of the will of the divine son
as having been ’ deified ’ (or ’ taken
possession of by ’), which might
imply that except for some action
of god upon it, the ’s will was
not divine. it does not wholly
remove the difficulty to say that the
’time ’ when that action took place
is, like the ’generation’ of which
it is one aspect, before and above
time. 2, τοῦ καθ’ ημᾶς] sc νοουμενου ;
‘considered according to us ’ means
‘considered as man.’ 3. ἀντιπίπτοντος] the human
will of christ, ace. to no was no
exception to the rule; though, as
his next quotation shews, it ceased
to struggle when it was assured
what ’s will was. 5. πάτερ, εἰ δὺν.] matt, xxvi 39 ;
luke xxii 42. 8. εκεῖνον] i.e. τὸν κατὰ τὸν
σωτηρα νοούμενον. 9. παρὰ τοῦ προσλαβόντος] the
divine son, as opp. to τὸ πρόσλημμα,
the nature which he assumed.
‘ο λόγος is john vi 38, not
the cry in the garden. 11. οὐχ ως ὄντος] ’it does not
imply that the son has a will of his
own, distinct from the ’s, but
that he has not.’ 13. τὸ συναγόμενον] the meaning
gathered from the words. 16. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ λεγ.] from the
illustrations which gr. proceeds to
give, it seems clear that the phrase
ἀπὸ κ. is used without any ref. to
τὸ κοινόν immediately before. with
the possible exception of the first,
they have nothing to do with the
peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists
between the father and the son.
we must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression
with a wider meaning. it is, however,
difficult to seize the exact
force of it. elias appears to have
thought that it meant ’ in α way
that common intelligence discerns.'
it prob. means ’in a general way,'
as distinguished from a pedantic
adaptation to special situations.
cp. κατὰ κοινοῦ § 13. 1 λεγονται b || 3 πάρα θεοῦ θεω ab || 9 om ειτουν ἀποκαταστάσεως cfg 1. καἰ οὐ θετικως] this is added
to bear out the assertion οὐχ ως
ὄντος, ἀλλ’ ως οὐκ ὄντος. the point
lies in this, that while the sentence,
rigidly analysed, implies the existence
of a fact, though it rejects an
inference drawn from the fact, the
speaker’s intention is to deny the
fact as well as the inference. thus
οὐ γὰρ εκ μετρου κτλ. implies that
the spirit is ‘given,’ though not
‘by by measure ’ ; but in reality it
does not affirm the giving, any
more than the measuring. again,
οὔτε η ἁμαρτία μου κτλ. implies
that the psalmist was guilty of sin,
though that guilt was not the cause
of the opposition which he en-
countered ; but the psalmist has no
intention of affirming his own sin.
again, οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ημ’. implies
that we have righteousnesses, though
we claim nothing on the ground of
them ; but st paul would never
admit that we have any. similarly,
’not mine own will, but thine’
implies the existence of a will of the
son, apart from the ’s ; but
if we consider the expression ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ, in a broad way, in view of
the common use of language, we see
that no assertion of the kind is
intended. ib. οὐ γὰρ εκ μετρου] john iii
34. in the explanatory sentence
θεός and θεω make equally good
sense. gr. prob. understood the
text as the a.v. does, supplying
’unto him.' but pern, the very
fact that this was the common intgerpretation
caused θεός to be changed
into θεω. 4. οὔτε η ἁμαρτί] ps. lviii 4
(lix 3). 5. οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ημ’.] α combination
of dan. ix 18 with tit.
iii 5. 7. δηλον δε τοῦτο] gr. returns
to the discussion of john vi 38 foil. 9. eh οὑν ἀποκατ.] gr. adds this
gloss, because in one sense unbelievers
also have an ἀνάστασις.  ὅγδοόν εστιν αὐτοῖς τό· ἵνα γινωσκωσι σε τὸν
μόνον ἀληθινὸν θεόν, καὶ ὃν ἀπεστειλας ἰησοῦν χριστόν· 1 om τὸ a ιι 5 νοης] διανοης cf: νόεις d ιι νογσεις] νόεις d ’or. 1’
13. 15 ἀοράτω] + καὶ f || 18 πως δάι d 1. τὸν λόγον τὸν ἅκ.] john xiv
24. the επεὶ carries us somewhat
abruptly back to the main thesis of
the section, οὐχ ως ὄντος κτλ. 6. καὶ παντὸς τοῦ εὐγν] sc. ὁ
λόγος. this is the usual interpretation
of the fathers. 13. ’λθ’. 8. — thee the only true
god and jesus christ, and there is
none good but one, that is, god.
there are other instances where
similar language does not exclude
the son. here, it is used to exclude
the false gods, and it is the common
godhead of the father and of the
which is addressed as the only
true god. the other text is an
answer to one who, thinking him to
be only a man, called him ‘good’;
whereas the goodness was that of the
godhead. if this argument does not
satisfy them., we can find them a
text which, on their principles, would
prove the son alone to be god. 8. ἵνα γινωσκωσι σε] john xvii 3. 10. οὐδεὶς ἀγαθός] mark x 18. 12. την αὐτοαληθειαν] viz. christ,

not upon κατὰ κ. gr. does not perceive
what difficulties he is landed
in, if he makes ’jesus christ' address
the godhead in general as
his sender. both nestorianism and
sabellianism are near at hand.

and λεγεσθαι in app. to
imaginary subject, ’ if it should
that,' etc. 5. ηττημεθα] the weapons that
were forged against the son, when
the text from john xvii 3 was under
discussion, beat the father off the
field (gr. purposely uses an outrageous
word), when we treat other
texts on the same principle. the
1st pers. is used because ex hypothesi
gr. has been converted (νικησειε) to
the view which he opposes. 14. no. 9. — to make intercession

element in εκδίκησιν ζητεῖν which
gr. pts away, but the thought of
appealing to a supreme power
against a foe too strong for the
appellant. ‘there would,' he
’be something even of abasement in
that.’ 12. πρεσβεύειν ὑπ’. ημ.] ’to act

the explanatory clause, τὰ σάρκ’.
λεγω π., shews that gr. is not here
concerned with our knowledge, but
only with ’s condition : γινωσκηται,
but for the text of 2 cor.,
might as well be η. 3. χ. της ἁμαρτίας] heb. iv 15. 4. καὶ παράκλητον] 1 john ii 1.

the strength of what he has suffered
in his character of man, he prevails
upon us to endure in his character
of the word and the encourager.’
thus gr. seems to recognise only
the manward aspect of the work of
the advocate. 15. no. 10 — the son knoweth
not the last day or hour. obviously
the wisdom through whom the
worlds, or ages, were made cannot
be ignorant of the length of their
duration ; and our saviour's s prophecies
concerning the last things
shetv that he knew. you cannot
know how the day ends without
knowing how the night begins. he
knew therefore as god, and knew
not as man. the title of the son,
standing by itself, lends itself to this
supposition. 12. μηδενα γινωσκειν] mark xiii

11. st paul is speaking of the
spirit, not of the son. 4. ἀκριβως επίσταται] as shewn,
no doubt, by his prophecies. ib. εν χρω] this seems to have
been the reading of elias ; and it is
found in the second hand of the
lincoln college ms. the expression
is both idiomatic and forcible, to
denote what happens right up to
the very moment of the end ; and,
as jahn points out, in his notes on
elias, the word οἶον would go more
naturally with it than with the tamer
εν χρόνω. the reading εν χρόνω may
easily be attributed to an early
copyist unfamiliar with the phrase
εν χρω, wno thought it an abbreviation
for εν χρόνω. 9. συνεισάγει] ‘implies,’ ‘involves’;
cp. iii 16. 11. τὸ φαῖν’. χωρίση τοῦ ν.] τὸ
νοούμενον may so naturally be used
in contrast with τὸ φαῖν’., as ’the
unseen' to ’the seen,' that probably
gr. must be understood to mean by
the first the lord's human nature,
and by τὸ νοούμ. the divine. so
elias takes it. but it might be
possible to take τὸ φ. = ‘ the look ’
of the saying, and τὸ νοούμ. = ‘ the
meaning? α casual reader, looking
only at τὸ φ., would think that an
absolute ignorance was predicated ;
but attentive examination would
shew that that is not τὸ νοούμενον. 12. τὸ γὰρ ἀπόλυτον κτλ.] the
γὰρ justifies the assertion εὔδηλον.
‘ for the fact that the title of " the
son " stands absolutely and without
conditions, nothing being added to
say whose son, suggests to us this
interpretation ; so that we put the
more reveiwit construction tipon the
ignorance, and attribute it to the
human nature, not to the divine.'
ἄσχετον is used in a remarkable
way, as if from σχεσις, ‘ ’
in the light of later criticism, the
fact which gr. notices may be
thought to tell in the opp. direction
: the absolute title seems to
denote the eternal relation, not the
temporary condition. see ’s
note in his st mark p. 297. gr. takes
the argument, as well as the illustrations
of τεῖχος, νύξ, from ath. οἱ. iii
c. ar. § 43, who says that if it had
stood ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, it would have
implied that the godhead did not
know, but that ὁ υἱός allows us to
suppose that the ignorance is that

to refer this knowledge, like everything
else which the son possesses,
to its absolute source in the father.
all expressions about his obedience
and the cost of it evidently apply
only to the nature which he assumed.
we pass to the consideration of his
many titles. 8. επὶ την αἰτίαν] ’ referred back
to the primary cause? i.e. the father.
ther. this has already been done
in the case of the son's power ;
it holds good of ’everything else'
which the son possesses ; they are
not his, but the father's, inasmuch
as the father alone is the source
of them. so it may be, gr. says.
with our lord's knowledge of great
matters. 10. των καθ’ ημᾶς φ. τις] he
means basil, who tells amphilochius
(epist. ccxxxvi) that this was the
interpretation which he had heard
εκ παιδὸς παρὰ των πατερων. the
same is found in the disp. c. arium
printed with the works of athanasius
§ 27). ib. μικρὸν εννοησαι] ‘ would see to
some extent.' the observation holds
true, even if we do not accept basil's
account of the particular passage
μηδε εκείνως ἀναγνούς). 11. η ως δ́τι ö π.] ’ except in so far
as he does so because the father
does.’ 12. τὸ συναγόμενον] cp. § 12.
the rgument is not very clear ;
but the ως δηλον appears to give the
reason, not for the son's knowing,
but for the son's knowing it from
the father. nothing but the πρωτη
φύσις can know, therefore the incarnate
son could not obtain the
knowledge in any other way than
from the father.  ἀρκτεον δε ημῖν εντεῦθεν. τὸ θεῖον ἀκατονόμαστον· 5 υπακοην] + και cdg || 9 ου] + περι dfg || 11 τοσουτον] τοσουτος d || 16 περι

all that god is. 19. ἀκατονόμαστον] ‘can have no
name.’ 21. ὅσον εἰκ. εδοσαν] we are not
directly informed what was the original
purpose of the custom to which

gr.'s account of the matter
somewhat confused. while it is
well known that the jews never
pronounced the name, there seems
to be no ground for saying that it
was written in a peculiar script. 3. ἀκοινωνητον] ‘ not right that
god should be put on a level
us. ’ 5. λυομενη] cp. ii 13. the
sound is uttered and melts away
and perishes ; it is therefore unsuitable
for expressing the indissoluble,
imperishable nature of god. 6. ἰδιάζουσαν] this epithet is
added in a not strictly logical position.
the fact that god's nature
is unique is no reason why it should
not be expressed in fleeting sounds.
the word is added in ref. to the
custom mentioned, of using a special
character. 8. περὶ αὐτόν] contrasted with
κατ’ αὐτόν. for gr.'s use of περί
with ace. see iii 10, 12. certain
facts in connexion with god are
known to us, and from these we
dimly and tentatively draw for ourselves
pictures of what he actually is. 9. ἄλλην ἀπ’ ἄλλου] we put our
mental image together, deriving
part of it from one quarter, part
from another. 11. ὁ δεσμός] elias is, no doubt,
right in understanding the bond
which binds the soul to the body.

it is not known whence gr. took

of athanasius from which it is
quoted by suicer, is of later date. 8. δαπανητικόν] cp. § 6. ib. πῦρ καταναλ.] heb. xii 29 ;

of ex. xx 2 and is. xlii 8. 12. κύριος ὄν. αὐτω] ex. xv 3. 13. φύσιν επιζ. κτλ.] ‘are in
quest of a nature (i.e. of a
which will properly denote a nature) ;
and a nature is a thing
dependent upon connexion with something
else.' gr. does not in these
words mean to describe a property
which distinguishes the divine nature
from others. it is a common
property of all natures. ‘man,’ for
ex., is not the name of a relationship,
but of a substantive thing ;
while ’husband,’ ’slave,’ 'cappadocian, ’
which express a relationship,
are not the names of a nature. 14. ἴδιον ὄντως θεοῦ] so εστίν.
what we are in quest of, we find in
the name ὁ ων ; for τὸ ὂν is the
special property of god, and belongs
to him in its entirety, not partially,
as it does to other beings, who only
have a share in existence. it is a
little surprising that gr. does not
say τὸ δε εἶναι, instead of τὸ δε ὄν.
perhaps it is because he has used τὸ
εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat
different sense (viz. of what a
thing is, rather than that it is) ; and
whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence
as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν
represents it as actually existing,
and so is better suited to denote the
fulness of the divine nature.  των δ’ ἄλλων προσηγοριων αἱ μεν της εξουσίας

of the verb is illustrated by the
subst. περικοπη, a passage in a
book with its beginning and ending
marked. 19. other titles signify his
power, like almighty, king, lord ;
others belong to his revelation of
himself in history, such as god of
vengeance, of salvation, of righteousness.
all these are common to the
three persons, each of whom has
his special appellation. those of
the son arc as follows. 4. οἰκονομίας] cp. iii 18. they
are ’dispensational’ names, whether
proper to the ’dispensation’ of the
incarnation, or independent of it. 5. οἶον ὁ μεν π.] titles of εξουσία:
‘ the almighty, and king, —
whether οφ glory, or θ’ etc. παντοκράτωρ,
as is evident from the
context, is correctly used as=
’master of all.’ 6. της δόξης] ps. xxiii (xxiv) 7. ib. των αἰωνων] 1 tim. i 17 (cp.

13 (lxviii 12) ὁ βασιλεὺς των δυνάμενων
του ἀγαπητοῦ, του ἂγἀπητοῦ.
the reading η τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ in the
mss. of gr. may be a trace of a
longer reading των δυνάμεων τοῦ
ἀγαπητοῦ, η τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ, which
would treat the second τοῦ ἂγ. in
the ps. as parallel to των δὺν., not
to the first τοῦ ἂγ. ib. των βασιλ.] 1 tim. vi 15. 8. ὀ κύριος, η σαβαωθ] ’and the

10. the art. shews that gr. is not
offering δὺν. as an alternative translation
of σαβαωθ, but as a fresh
title, depending directly upon κύριος.

παντοκράτωρ) represent the same

36 (lxviii 8, 35). the epithets are
gr.'s own addition, intended to interpret
the phrase. ὁρωντος θεόν
seems to be introduced in ref. to
the circumstances in which jacob’s
name was changed (gen. xxxii 30). 2. τρισὶ τούτοις] the three things
are (1) fear of punishment, (2) hope
of salvation and of glory, (3) practice
of virtues. it might seem a more
logical classification to make the
third the ‘hope of glory,’ the ‘practice
of virtues’ being added to shew
how the motives which gr. has
mentioned act. but this is forbidden
by the τὸ δε των ἀρετων
below. διοικούμεθα therefore is
used in a somewhat different sense
with ἀσκησει from what it is with
δεει and ελπίδι. we are governed
by two great prevailing motives,
and on one great moral principle. 4. ἀσκ. των ἀρ. εξ ων τ.] ‘the
practice of the virtues which result
in these.’ ταῦτα sc. σωτηρία and
δόξα. 5. των σωτηρίων] ps. xxvii
(xxviii) 8, lxvii 20 (lxviii 19), lxxxiv
5 (lxxxv 4). it is prob. the plur.
of σωτηριον, and not to be written
σωτηριων. 6. των ἀρετων] sc. δικαιοσύνης,
εἰρηνης. ib. ἵν᾿ ως τὸν θεόν κτλ.] α comparison
of what is said of enos in
ii 18 would suggest that τούτων τι
means the φόβος and the ελπίς. α
man who carries within him the
presence of the god of vengeance
and of salvation, and thus attains
to some measure of fear and hope,
is spurred on to seek moral perfection
and the kinship with god which
comes of it. this gives more point
to the sentence than if ἄσκησις itself
is included in τούτων τι. 8. οἰκείωσιν] cp. ii 17 τω οἰκείω. 9. ετι] ‘so far.’ 13. ωρμηθη λεγειν] ‘meant at the
outset to say.’ cp. ii 11. 20. he is the son, only begotten,
word, wisdom, power, truth,
image, light, life, righteousness,
sanctification, redemption,
resurrection. 20, 2 μονον] μόνος e2 || 13 συνεστηκεν] συνεστη καὶ c 1. εκεῖνο] sc. ὄπερ ὁ πατηρ. kἀκεῖθεν,
sc. εκ τοῦ πατρός. ib. μόνον] ’nothing but a son.'
cp. iii 5. 3. μονοτρόπως] ‘by a single process,’
as distinguished from corporeal
births, to which various processes
contribute through a long space of
time. cp. iii 4. 4. πρὸς νοῦν λόγος] ‘ his relation
to the father is that of word to
mind.’ ib. διὰ τὸ ἀπαθες] i.e. to indicate
that when he is called son, there
is nothing of ‘ passion ’ in his generation.
the title of ’word’ does
more than this; it indicates the
abiding connexion between the
word and god, — for mind and
word are inseparable, — and also the
fact that he gives expression to the
mind of god. 6. ὄρος] ‘definition, for λόγος is
used in this sense also.'

image; ενταῦθα, in the case of
the son. κινουμενου suggests that
gr. understood εἰκων to apply only
to pictures or effigies of persons. 5. τὸ ἀπαράλλακτον] παραλλαγη
would express the slight variations
that occur in all cases of human
copying, or in the course of generations.
there is ‘ less ’ of such
variation in the ’s representation
of his father, than there was when
adam begat seth κατὰ την ἰδεαν
αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ την εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ
(gen. v 3). by ’less’ gr. of course
means that there is none. 6. των ἁπλων] such as god’s. 7. τω μεν...τω δε] not here the
dative of comparison, but kin this
particular, and in that.’ 8. ταὐτὸν μ. η ἀφομ.] ’ identical
rather than like.’ 9. φως] john i 9 etc. ib. λόγω] gr. seems to mean
rather the reasoning mind, which
takes account of truth, than speech;
’ cleansed in mind and life. ’ this
is shewn by the parallels ἄγνοια,
γνωσις, which follow. 11. ζωη] john xi 25 etc. he is
life, just because, as has been
shewn, he is light. 12. οὐσί ωσις] ’ the giving of being. ’
he is that by virtue of which all
reasonable creatures have permanence
and substantive existence. ib. εν αὐτω γάρ] acts xvii 28.
the words are not said of the son. 14. καὶ πνοην...καὶ πν.ἅγ.] gen.
ii 7, john xx 22. εκεῖθεν in the
same way as at the beginning of

him the ‘ breath of life ’ ; as many
as are capable of it have received
the holy spirit, in measure proportioned
to our receptivity.  ταῦτα μεν οὖν ετι κοινὰ τοῦ τε ὑπερ ημᾶς καἰ 4 τὸ μεν . ..το δε] τω μεν...τω ’δε f || 10 ἀπανιστὰς ημας ace || απανιστας]

131. cp. ii 6. ib. δικαιοσύνη] 1 cor. i 30. gr.
does not see in the passage any ref.
to justification. christ is ‘righteousness’
inasmuch as he awards
in all cases what is meet and right.
as examples of such award, he
mentions the judging justly between
those under the law and those under
grace, and between soul and body.
διαιτᾷν with the dat. is 'to arbitrate
for or between.' by arbitrating between
those under law and grace
respectively, gr. prob. meant that
in the final settlement of rewards
and punishments account will be
taken of the opportunities which
each man has enjoyed in life. 3. ψυχη κ. σωματι] cp. i 7. 6. ἁγιασμός] 1 cor. i 30. as
being himself all purity, lie cannot
but sanctify those to whom he
comes, in order that that which is
pure, i.e. the revelation of god,
may be received by purity, i.e. by
souls which are characterized by it. 7. ἀπολύτρωσις] 1 cor. i 30. 9. λύτρον] mark x 45 ; cp. 1 tim.
ii 6. ib. της οἰκ. καθ’] ‘ sufficient to
cleanse the world.’ 10. ἀνάστασις] john xi 25. εντεῦθεν
= from this world.' gr. does
not seem to intend εντ’. ημ’. ἀπανιστάς
to refer to the bodily resurrection.
but to the spiritual and
moral resurrection of which the next
clause speaks. 21. the foregoing belong to him
both as god and as man ; the following
belong to him as incarnate:—
man, son of man, christ, way,
door, shepherd, sheep, lamb, high
priest, melchizedck. he must be-
thought ὁ ἃς god and man, — as
god unchanged in assuming the
manhood. 12. ετι] as in § 19; ‘ thus far.’ ib. τοῦ τε ὑπερ ημ.] it would
be quite in keeping with gr.'s usage
to make the τοῦ masc., ’him who is
above us and him who came to be
what he is for our sakes'; cp. § 7.
but perhaps we may give gr. the
benefit of the doubt and take the
word as neut., as it is below. 21. 1 δι’ ημας] καθ’ ημας ’reg. cypr.' || 6 τω κατακριθεν a || 8 οσων]

and yet not by, the law of birth (or
genration)' ; as born by natural
descent from adam, and by natural
birth from his mother, though his
conception was miraculous. 15, χρίσις γὰρ αὕτη] repeated
from § 2. ib. οὐκ ενεργείᾳ] ιν the case of
other ’ anointed ’ ones the godhead
sanctifies them by exerting energy
upon them ; but in the case of
christ’s humanity the sanctification
was due to the indwelling of the
entire power which sanctifies. the
effect of this is that that anointing
power in him bears the name of
god, while that which it anoints is
raised to godhead. in. this statevisible
ment we have the converse of that
inexactness which has been referred
to above. it is not really τὸ χρίον,
strictly speaking, which is called
man, but ὁ χρίων. 16. ὁδός] john xiv 6. 17, θύρα] john x 9. ib. ποιμην] john x 11. 7 αμνος] αμνον f || 8 μελχ. ’δε] om ’δε e 1. εἰς τ. χλδης...ὀδηγων] ps. xxii

ez. xxxiv 16. 6. πρόβατον...ἀμνός] is. liii 7.
the word τελειον (not τελειος) is evidently
used in its homeric sense, 'a

κτλ. ; heb. xiii 8. gr. ends with
something of a ’riddle,’ in order to
fix his teaching in the memory.
the words from ἰησοῦς to σωματικως
form the subject ; ὁ αὐτὸς πν. is the
predicate. the interpr. which gr.
has just put upon the title χριστός
must be borne in mind. he seems
to take χθ. κ. σημ’ closely together,
in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during
these last few days,' — not, of course,
like πρωην τε καἰ χθες, excluding the
present, but including it. with σωματικως
cp. col. ii 9; the adverbs
have no verbs to qualify, unless ων
or ὑπάρχων be supplied. for πνευματικως
= νοουμενας see westcott on
heb. ix 14. the sentence is therefore:
’jesus, anointed with the whole
indwelling godhead, who now for a
few days has been in bodily form, is,
considered according to the inward
principle of his being, the same
unchanged personality that he was
before his incarnation, and will be
so for ever.’ 3 αιωνας] + των αἰωνων df
