ἀλωπεκας μικροὺς ἀφανίζοντας ἀμπελωνας.
gr. joins μικροὺς with ἀμπ.
instead of ἀλωπ., understanding the
sentence to denote the meanness of
the ‘foxes’ (i.e. jackals), which did
not venture to attack the large vineyeards,
and spoiled the small ones
instead.  τί τοῦτο επαθον, ω φίλοι καὶ μύσται καὶ της

clause—like sic demum; ’not
it has got rid of these.’ ib. πλαξὶ...λιθίναις] ex. xxiv 12.
α somewhat difficult turn in the
application of the narrative. gr.,
or rather his λόγος as identified with
him, has ascended the mountain,
with a view to having impressed upon
him, or upon it, the teaching of god,
as the commandments were upon
the tables of stone. the epithets
στερραῖς κ. θ. are intended to convey
the thought of something —
no transient impression. 5. ἀμφοτερωθεν] ex. xxxii 15.
again a somewhat fantastic application.
one side of the tables is
seen—one part of the λόγος is
—by every one; but there is a
reverse which only few can read,
viz. those who succeed in reaching
the mountain top φθάνουσιν). this
use of φθάνειν is familiar in the
ν. t. 3. when he has reached the appointed
spot, he can only see the ‘back
parts’ of god. 8. μύσται] those who are initiated
into the mysteries. 9. καταληψόμενος] ‘as if i were
about to apprehend god.’ 11. διεσχον] ‘penetrated’: cf. horn.
il. v 99 ἀντικρὺ δε διεσχε. gr. uses
it § 31 of penetrating through the
veil of the tabernacle. ib. ὕλης] ’matter.’ 12. συστραφείς] ‘having gathered
myself up’: cp. plat. rep. 1 p. 336
συστρεψας εαυτὸν ωσπερ θηρίον ηκεν
εφ’ ημᾶς. 13. τὰ ὀπίσθια] ex. xxxiii 23. ib. τη πετρᾳ σκεπασθείς] ex.
xxxiii 23 σκ. τη χειρί μου. this interpretation
of the ‘ cleft in the rock,’
made familiar to englishmen by
’s hymn, is very ancient.
cp. iren. iv xx 9 ‘uidebit...in altitudine
petrae, hoc est, in eo qui est
secundum hominem eius aduentu,’
the incarnation gives an assured
point from which we may observe
and study god, without being overwelmed
by the greatness of the
revelation. the glories of the divine
nature are tempered for us, as it
were, by the human life which
encompasses us as we look out from
it to the divine. by the incarnation,
our field of contemplation is at once
restricted and made clear. 1 om θεω acd ǁ 6 ὅσα] ως ‘reg. a’ 1. διακύψας] ‘peering through
the aperture,’ εἶδον must be
again before φύσιν. 2. την πρωτην] in ref. to ex.
xxxiii 20 οὐ δυνηση ἰδεῖν μου τὸ πρόσωπον.
ἀκηρατος practically, if not
etymologically, = ἀκεραιος ‘pure,’
‘unmixed.’ cp. arist. de mundo
ii 5 στοιχεῖον ἅκ. τε καὶ θεῖον. gr.
adds λ. δ. τη τριάδι lest he should
suggest the sabellian notion of a
self-conscious nature distinct from
the persons in whom it resides. 3. τ. πρωτου καταπ.] i.e. as reckoned
from the seat of the divine
presence, not as in heb. ix 3 in the
order of human approach. 4. ὁ. τ. χερουβὶμ σηκ.] it seems
more natural to suppose that gr.
refers to the cherubim covering the
mercy seat (ex. xxv 20 [19]), than
to the decoration of the veil (ex.
xxvi 31). cp. ezek. xxviii 14, 16,
where, however, there is nothing in
most texts of the lxx. to represent
’covering.’ 5. τελευταία] to recall τὰ ὀπίσθια.
φθάνουσα as above. id. η δε] gr. does not of course
mean to distinguish sharply between
the πρωτη and τελευταία φύσις, as
if they were separate natures. he
means the expressed and unexpressed
parts or aspects of the same nature.
the danger of misunderstanding is
not felt in greek, where words like
πρωτος, μεσος and the like, are commonly
monly used in a partitive sense; e.g.
ὁ πρωτος ποὺς ’the front of the foot.’ 6. ὅσα εμε γινωσκειν] sc. πάρεστι.
ib. ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ] sc. τοῦ θεοῦ, to be
supplied from θεοῦ τὰ ὀπίσθια above. 8. μεγαλοπρεπεια] used of god
nine times in the pss.; μεγαλειότης is
not. prob. gr. refers esp. to ps.
viii 2 (1), ciii (civ) 1 (in some texts),
cx (cxi) 3, or cxliv (cxlv) 5, 12, where
the word is used in connexion with
god's works. gr. prefers the word
because it expresses dot the abstract
quality, like μεγαλειότης, but the impression
produced by its manifesta-
tion. 9. ὅσα μετ’ εκεῖνον εκ. γνωρ.] ‘all
the indications of himself which he
has lift behind him,’ elias

15. for κράματος see i 7. 4. to form an adequate con-
ception of god is even more impossible
than to express it when formed. it
is doubtful whether even angels can
do it. 12. ἀρκτεον] from ἄρχεσθαι: ‘we
must begin ’ the hopes with
which he had begun at first ως θεὸν
καταληψόμενος) have proved fallacious. 13. ως τις των παρ᾿ ε. θεολόγων]
the reference appears to be to
timaeus 28 ε τὸν μεν οὖν ποιητην
καὶ πατερα τοῦ παντὸς εὑρεῖν τὸ εργον,
καὶ εὕροντα εἰς πάντας ἀδύνατον λεγειν.
no approval is conveyed by the expression
θεολόγων τις. cp. v 16. 14. οὐκ ἀτεχνως] plato thus art-
fully insinuates, in gr.'s opinion,
that he has himself apprehended
what he says is so difficult to appre
hend, and at the same time escapes
exposure by saying that it is inexpressible
τω (ἀνεκφρ.). 17. ἀδυνατωτερον] because if only
the conception could be formed, expression
would be comparatively
easy. cp. novatian de trin. § 4
nomen dei edici non potest, quolacious.
niam non potest nee concipi.  τοῦτο μεν οὖν ενταῦθα κείσθω· τὸ δε ημετερον, 1 τάχα ἀν’] + καὶ e ǁ 4 καταβεβλακευμενοις] κατεβλ. acf ‘duo colb. or. 1’ ||

is here a word of approbation, ‘if
not satisfactorily, yet dimly at any
rate.’ 4. μη ὅτι] ‘not to speak ’ cp.
§ 11. καταβεβλ. from βλάξ, which
is thought to be a collateral form of
μαλακός, ‘slack,’ ‘enfeebled,’ ‘enervated.’ 6. γεννητη] not= γενητη ‘created,’
for gr. goes on to speak of the
higher created intelligences as a separate
class afterwards; but strictly
‘begotten’ or ‘born,’ i.e. existing under
physical conditions, the effect of
which is described in the following
clause. 7. επιπροσθεῖ] the verb is formed
from the adv. επίπροσθεν: ‘to be in
front of,’ so ‘get in the way of.’
wyttenbach collects many instances
of its use in his note on plut. de
recta and. ratione p. 41 c. ib. σαρκίον] the diminutive ex-
presses depreciation. 8. πρός] ‘in reference to,’
it comes to a matter οf.’ ib. οὐκ οἴδα δε, εἰ μη] of course indicates
gr.’s opinion that it is impossible.
this was the general
opinion. cp. chrys. horn, de incomprehensibili

ἀρχαῖς καἰ εξουσίαις λαὶ δυνάμεσι καὶ
ἁπλως πάση τη κτίσει. 10. τυχὸν ἂν καὶ τρανοῖντο] τρανόω,
a favourite word of gr.'s, usually
= ‘to make plain’ (e.g. § 20).
as τρανός is sometimes used in the
more active sense of ‘clear,’ i.e. of
penetrating intelligence (e.g. wisd.
vii 22), it seems best to understand
τρανοῖντο here in that way, ‘gifted
with insight and intelligence.’ 12. εκτυπωτερον] ‘ more expressly,’
’distinctly.’ 5. the works of god are beyond
our present comprehension, much
more himself; we can only affirm
for certain that he exists. 14. κείσθω] ‘be dropped.’ he
not wish to pursue the question with
regard to the superior intelligences:

. . . .λεγω δε d 1. ὑπερεχει π. νοῦν] phil, iv 7. 3."/> μητε ὀφθ. ὁρατά κτλ.] 1 cor.
ii 9. gr. forgets, as most people do,
that st paul adds ημῖν γὰρ ἀπεκάλυψεν
ὁ θ. διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος. 4. κατὰ μικρὸν γοῦν] γοῦν corrects,
but limits the concession;
‘not contemplated by the mind—
well, only to small estent.’ 6. τὰς σκιάς] ‘the outlines.’ ib. ὄψομαι κτλ.] ps. viii 4 (3). 8. τ. εν αὐτ’. πάγιον λόγον] πάγιος
from the root of πηγνυμι, ‘firm,’
‘fixed’; ‘the well established order
that prevails among them.’
words are a paraphrase of ‘which
thou hast ordained.’ ib. ὀψόμενος δε εστιν ὅτε] gr.
calls attention to the fact that the
ps. uses the future, not the present. 9. η ὑπερ τ....φύσις] ὑπερεχει
πάντα νοῦν. it is a little odd to say,
“note only the peace of god, but
god himself, passeth understanding.’’
we might have expected,
‘if the peace of god passeth understanding,
much more god himself.’’ 10. ἄληπτός τε κ.ἀπερίλ.] ‘inapprehensible
as it is and incomprehensible.’ 11 οὐχ ὅτι εστιν, ἁλλ’ ητις εστίν]
may be taken either with ἄληπτος
κ. ἀπερίληπτος, or with the main
verb ὑπερεχει π. νοῦν. perh. the
latter is the more forcible: ‘ι do
not mean that the fact of its existence
passes understanding, but the
nature of it.’ ib. οὐ γὰρ κενόν κτλ.] 1 cor.
xv 14, 17. the γὰρ implies that it
would be ‘vain’ if we were unable
truly to apprehend the fact of god's
existence. 13. ὃ δογματίζομεν] ‘nor is that
the doctrine which i am laying
down.’ ib. εὐγνωμοσύνην] cp. εὐγνωμονος
above, i 5. it resembles επιείκεια,
‘reasonableness.’ μη πάλιν,
cp. i 4 μη πάλιν επιφυεσθωσαν. 14. κατεπαρθης] ‘exalt yourself
against me.’ cp. cyr. al. c. ful. i
p. 6.  τοῦ μεν γὰρ εἶναι θεόν, καὶ την πάντων ποιητικην

nature assures us. we are forced to
think of a creator when we look
upon creation, as the sight of a lyre
makes us think of the lyre-maker.
but beyond that, we have no certainty. 4. συνεκτικην] from συνεχειν, δ’
maintain in harmony’: cp. col. i
τὰ πάντα εν αὐτω συνεστηκεν. so
xen. cyrop. 8 p. 140 οἱ θεοὶ] την
των ὅλων τηνδε τάξιν συνεχουσιν
ἀτριβη. for the construction, την
π. π. αἰτίαν is strictly (with θεόν)
the subject of εἶναι. the def. art.
is used in the same way as in participial
sentences like εἰσὶν...οἱ τ. ἀκ.
προσκνωμενοι (above, p. 1); where
our idiom rather puts ’a’ than ‘the’;
‘that there is a god and a creative
cause.’ 5. ὁ φυσικὸς νόμος] gr. does not
here mean ‘natural law’ in
modern sense, although such an use
might readily be paralleled. the
explanatory clause below shews that
he does not mean ‘the law which
we observe in the natural order
around us,’ but the natural
upon ourselves of the observations
which we make. cp.
below ταῖς φυσικαῖς ἀποδείξεσιν. ib. προσβάλλουσα] ‘lighting upon.’ 6. κ. πεπηγόσι] πεπηγα (from
πηγνυμι) has the intrans. sense, ‘to
be fixed.’ k. πεπ. κ. ὁδ’. κ. κιν. κ.
are predicates of τοῖς ὁρ.; ‘seeing
them fixed’ ect. 8. συλλογιζόμενος] when we see
the order in nature the natural
result upon ourselves is to infer the
existence of an ἀρχηγός i.e. ‘author.’ 10. οὐσιωσαντος] οὐσιόω=‘to give
οὐσία,’ ‘bring into being.’ 11. κιθάραν...κάιλιστα ησκημενην]
cp. paley's famous argument about
the watch. ἀσκεῖν like εξασκεῖν, = 
exornare; see horn. od. i 439:
‘beautifully and elaborately made.’ 15. ταῖς ὄψεσιν] contrasted with
τη διανοίᾳ: ‘he will pass ἀναδ. because
higher up, further back, in
the order of thought or causation)
to him in thought, although he may
not be acquainted with him by sight.’
the unusual pl. ταῖς ὄψ. might mean
either ‘by his (the player's) looks,’
or ‘by his (the hearer's) sight.’
latter makes the best parallel to
διαν.; it is also used in this sense by
herodian 6 (9, 10) ως εν ὄψεσιν ην
’when he came in sight.’ 6 om ποτε ‘or. 1’ 1. τὸ ποιητ δηλον] ‘the creating
power is plain.’ 2. ἀγνωμων] here ‘unreasonable,’
‘deficient in sense.’ 3. κ. ταῖς φ. επ’. ἀποδ.] the καὶ
joins επόμενος to εκουσίως, not to
προίων. 4. ἀλλ’ οὐδε τοῦτο] a very difficult
passage. the usual interpretation
makes ἀλλὰ answer to the μη
in μη προιων, ‘who will not go as far
as this, but (says) that not even this,
which we have imagined, is god.’
but it is harsh to supply the necessary
φάσκων or ὁμολογων in order to make
the clause grammatical; and a comparison
with the sentence in § 12
where gr. resumes his thread after a
long digression, seems to shew that we
must assign an entirely different meaning
to the present sentence,—and
which will accord better with grammatical
requirements. in ε 12 gr.
says that the proposition from which
he had started was τὸ μη ληπτὸν
εἶναι ἀνθρωπίνη διανοίᾳ τὸ θεῖον, μηδε
ὅλον ὅσον εστὶ φαντάζεσθαι. here,
accordingly, we must suppose, that
it is gr. himself, and not the λίαν
ἀγνωμων, who denies εἶναι θεὸν ὅπερ
εφαντ’. it is, he says, very unreasonable
not to accept the natural proofs
of god's existence, and in following
them we are compelled to form certain
great outlines of a conception
of god (e.g. creative power, rational
method, etc.), which we cannot
doubt to be correct. but even this
is not the same thing as to identify
εἶναι ὅπερ) god with what we have
imagined, or figured to ourselves,
or what our reason has delineated.
τοῦτο is the subject of εστὶν understood,
of which εἶναι θ. κτλ. is the
predicate. while we have ἀποδείξεις
for the one belief, we have none
for the other. 5. ὑπεγραψεν] cp. i pet. ii 21
ὑπογραμμόν ‘a sketch.’ 6. εν περινοίᾳ τ....εγενετο] gr.
uses the same expression in or. xlv
§ 11: οὐ γὰρ οἶόν τε ἄλλως εν περινοίᾳ
θεοῦ γενεσθαι σωματος ὑλικοῦ καὶ
δεσμίου νοῦ πάχος μη βοηθούμενον.

denote an embracing in thought, a
mental taking in of the subject.

mean that the fact of being περιγραπτόν
would by itself preclude
being σεπτόν, but that all that is
connoted by περιγράπτω would.  ηως δε καὶ σωθησεται τὸ διὰ πάντων διηκειν καὶ

14 και] η e 1. λύεσθαι] treated as something
further than ἀναλ. the component
elements might conceivably be separated
and yet something remain;
but λ. would be the complete break
up of the whole thing. ib. σύνθεσις] the blending of
different elements introduces a possibility
of conflict, and so of division,
and so of destruction; which is unthinkable
in connexion with him
who, if he exists at all, must be the
πρωτη φύσις, or primary existence,
into which no earlierexistence enters.
elias observes that the ‘platonic’
form of the argument is particularly
applicable to the heretical dialecticians
whom gr. has in view. 5. εκ των τελ.] in other words,
the contention that god is not ‘a
body’ is proved by a reductio
absurdum. 8. besides, if god were corporeal,
his corporeity must involve either
the denial of all other corporeities, or
his interpenetration with them. even
on the supposition of a ‘fifth element’
which might be identified with his
corporeity, he would be made subject
to motion and to space. 8. τὸ οὐχί] jer. xxiii 24. 9. πνεῦμα κ.] wisd. i. 7. the
book is treated as authoritative. 10. τὸ μεν...τὸ δε] it seems logically
best, if grammatically less obvious,
to take τὸ μεν as the direct
ace. after περιγράφοι and τὸ δε as
the indirect ace. after περιγράφοιτο;
‘if god should circumscribeonething
and be circumscribed with another.’
this, it is assumed, must be the
case if god were ‘a body.’ 11. η γάρ] as often, ‘for otherwise
either’etc. ib. διὰ κενοῦ...τ. παντός] ‘the
universe which he pervades must
be empty.’ 12. ἵν’ ὑβρισθη] an answer to the
implied rhetorical question, ‘and
why must everything perish?’
order that god may be doubly outraged,
by being made a body, and
by being deprived of all that he has
created.’ 14. ἀδύνατον] because ‘bodies’
are mutually exclusive. 2 τεμνει] τεμει c || 3 γραωδεστερον] + ως οἱ περι ταύτα εσχολακότες εληρησαν
bde el ǁ 9 διοίσομαι] μεν ‘reg. a’ ib. πλακησεται κτλ.] πλακ. from
πλεκω ‘to weave,’ so ‘entangle,’
it is a somewhat strange
use of the simple verb; but gr. has
elsewhere θεω πλακηναι καἰ θεὸν
γενεσθαι εκ της μίξεως. ἀντιπ.
‘bring into juxtaposition.’
gr. understands by the two words is
explained by the comparison with
mixing liquids. 1. τὸ μεν τεμνει] sc. ὁ θεός; the
fut. τμηθ. shews that gr. is no longer
thinking of the liquids, though no
doubt it was the comparison with
them which caused the pres. τεμνει.
the supposed interpenetration of the
σωμα of god with other σωματα
necessitates constant breaches of
continuity in both. 2. επικ. ἀτόμων] cp. p. 19
above. 3. γραωδεστερον] cp. 1 tim.
iv 7. the words which follow in
some authorities must be an ancient
gloss. if they belonged to the text

ms. places them. ib. διαπεσεῖται] ‘fall through,’
‘come to ’; plat. phaed. 80 c.
the subject of διαπ. is ὁ π. τ σ.
λόγος. 4. σωμα οὐχ νεῖ] it is difficult
in english to keep up the play on
the word σωμα. gr. means of course
that the argument for a corporeal
existence of god proves unsubstantail:
it has no πηξιν, ‘solidity’ (cp.
πάγιος λόγος in § 5). 5. εἰ δε ἄυλον] ἁ priv. and ὕλη.
the protasis is broken up into εἰ μεν
τὸ πεμπτον and εἰ δε ἄλλο τι παρὰ τὸ
πεμπτον. then the first apodosis is
broken up likewise into εστω μεν
and κατὰ τί δε. ib τὸ πεμπτον] the reference
is to the aristotelian conception of
a “quintessence,” or fifth “element,”
besides earth, air, fire and water.
cp. bas. hex. 11. 7. εστω μεν] gr. is willing to
assume for the moment that there is
such a thing as the imagined quintessence:
οὐδεν νῦν διοίσομαι, ‘i will
not now differ.’ 8. κατὰ την αὐτόνομον κτλ.]
almost each word here requires annotation.
λόγος is ‘the σωμα,’
or perhaps ἀσωματον σωμα φορὰν
at first sight seems to refer to την
κύκλω φ. just above; but there is
prob. no such play upon the word
intended. gr. seems to employ it
in the sense of ‘usage.’ although
no other example of the subst. in
that sense is at hand, the verb is not
infrequently so used. gr. has διὰ
γλωσσης φερειν ‘to speak of.
ἀναπλάττειν and its derivatives are
frequent in gr. sometimes the prep.
has its full force, ‘re-construction,’
‘fashioning afresh,’ as for ex.
baptism; sometimes it is simply ‘to
fashion,’ ‘imagine.’ thus he
of matter ὕλην) as ὑποστᾶσαν εξ οὐκ
ὄντων, κἄν τινες ἀγεννητον ἀναπλάττωσιν.
so here he seems to mean
the ‘shaping’ which the aristotelians
put upon the word, with a slight
suggestion of its being a factitious
and not the legitimate construction.
this is further expressed by calling
it αὐτόνομον, ‘their inderpendent,’
arbitrary, ‘use and construction of
the word.’ 3 καὶ τοῦτο om καὶ e ǁ 4 τὸ τὸ πὰν] τοῦτο τὸ πὰν b: τὸ πὰν aef || 8 οἱ
ἄγγελοι ‘reg. a’ || αν e ποσον]+αν e ‘duo colb. or. 1’ 1. κατὰ τί] gr. seems to mean
’in what respect,’ ‘by virtue
what part of its being, will this
πεμπτον, which is identified with
the σωμα of god, take its place
among the things which move and
revolve?’ it is, however, he
a ὕβρις, a wanton affront, to assign
such a place to god at all, whatever
may be the answer to his question. 4. δωσουσι] ‘will grant’:
sc. that god is ὁ φερων. ib. τί δε τὸ τοῦτο π. κινοῦν] τοῦτο
=τὸ πεμπτον: it (viz. god) moves
other things, and itself moves with
them; what then moves it? the τὸ
πᾶν which follows will then include
the thing which sets τὸ πεμπτον in
motion. 6. εν τόπω] motion is a change
of space- relations, and therefore implies
a local position. 7. εἰ δε ἄλλο τι] the other alternative
(viz. that the σωμα of god
is not the πεμπτον) is again confronted
with a dilemma; εἰ μεν ἀγγελ.,
εἰ δε ὑπερ ταῦτα. 8. πόθεν ὅτι] ’xvhence comes the
belief ’ ’how do they know
that?’ ib. πδσον...εἴη] in better greek
there would of course be an ἄν:
‘how far far would god excel an angel? 10. εἰσηχθη] the aor. gives a
liveliness to the argument: the logical
consequences are represented as
having taken actual effect; as in i 2. id. εσμός] ‘a swarm,’ said to
derived from ἵημι. ἀλόγιστος= ‘innumerable,’
though its possible sense
of ‘irrational’ may perh. have suggested
to gr. the ’abyss of nonsense’
which follows. στηναι, ‘to stop.’
is not clear why the notion that
god's (supposed) σωμα is superior to
angelic bodies should ‘again introduce
a countless swarm of bodies.
perhaps by πάλιν. only means
that this notion is in that respect no
better than the former one, because
it also implies that the angels have
bodies. otherwise he must mean
that the supposition of a body far
superior to angelic bodies leaves
room for the invention of swarms of
intermediate bodies between the angelic
bodies and it.  οὕτω μεν οὖν οὐ σωμα ημῖν ὁ θεός. οὐδε γὰρ
ηδη τις τοῦτο των θεοπνεύστων η εἶπεν η παρεδεξατο,

about god, but a negative truth gives

elias says, a heathen and esp. a
stoic speculation. 3. της ημ’. αὐλης] ‘ does not belong

confession that he is incorporeal
does not amount to a positive statement
or description of his being. 7. περὶ θεοῦ η περὶ θεόν] the
construction with the ace. is the less
direct, and therefore suits better the
scrupulous εὐλάβεια of gr.'s language:
‘of god or in connexion with
god.’ 8. τί γὰρ ὄντι αὐτω the κατὰ
την φ. is to be taken with ὑπάρχει,
not with ὄντι. the sense is, ‘what
substantive element is it in god's
being, what light does it throw upon
his nature and underlying essence,
to say that he has no beginning,’
etc.? ὑπόστασις is used in its older,
untechnical sense, ‘person,’ but
’substance,’ as in heb. i 3. 9. εξίστασθαι...περατοῦσθαι] εξίστ.

generally to any existing thing which

‘deny this if you can; or let us
take it as self-evident and pass on.’
the μεν is strictly answered by επεὶ

break between them as is indicated
by the usual division of chapters. 10. 3 τις ἀν’] om ἀν’ d ιι 7 η τινι] εν τινι e || 10 μελλοι] -λει d 10. gr. makes a digression to

exist at all.’ 5. πάντως επείπερ εστὶν η... η] ‘it

...or.’ 7. η τινι, η πανταχοῦ] ‘it must
reside either in α section of the universe,
or extending throughout the
whole: the passage which follows
is characterized by gr. himself (in
§ 11) as σκολιὸν γριφοειδες. editors,
therefore, and translators may
be excused if they have made nonsense
of it by wrong punctuation
and by impossible renderings. the
drift, however, is plain enough. gr.
places his opponent in a dilemma.
if the divine being is located in a
section of the universe, it is circumscribed
by something relatively small
τοῦ τινός=the supposed section,
ελάττονος in comparison with τὸ
πᾶν); a notion which is manifestly
absurd. if on the other hand it is
located in the universe at large, yet
still (ex hypothesi) within the universe,
then, though the thing which
circumscribes it is relatively great
πλ. καὶ ἄλλου πολλοῦ=‘greater than
other great things’), yet none
less it is as much circumscribed as
in the former case. this follows
from the very statement that τὸ θεῖον
is ‘in’ the universe, which at once
involves the relation of the thing
containing to the thing contpined
(grammatically τὸ περιεχόμενον is in
apposition to the subject of περιγραφησεται,
and τοῦ περιεχοντος to
ελάττονος τοῦ τινός and to πλείονος
respectively). to complete the argument,
however, it is necessary to
postulate εἰ...μελλοι) that the universe
is not positively infinite but
contained within itself if within nothing
else, and that as it consists of
space-relations it cannot he exempt
from the possibility of circumscription.
(the grammar of the last
clause is apparently irregular, and
some word like χρη must be supplied
from μελλοι; but it is possible that
gr. intends μελλοι to stand absolutely
and impersonally in both clauses
(=‘it is to be a ’), making τό
πᾶν περισχ. ace. and inf., like μ.
τόπον εἶναι).  τίνος οὖν ενεκεν ταῦτα διηλθον, καὶ περιεργότερον
ἴσως η κατὰ τὰς των πολλων ἀκοάς, καὶ κατὰ τὸν νῦν
κεκρατηκότα τύπον των λόγων, ὃς τὸ γενναῖον καὶ ἁπλοῦν

om κάτα b 1. καὶ που] ’and, still assuming
that τὸ θεῖον is located in the universe,
where was it,’ etc. 2. οὐδεν ην τὸ δ.] gr. turns to
the other horn of his first dilemma,
and asks, what is there (if τὸ θεῖον
is above the universe) to divide between
tween the universe and it? the
past tense ην, ενοηθη) in the preg-
nant greek idiom refers back to the
moment when the opponent is supposed
to have adopted the con-
clusion. 3. τὸ ὑπερ τοῦτο] i.e. ὑπερ τὸ πᾶν. 4. τὸ ὑπεραῖρον κ. ὒ.] ὑπεραίρειν
‘to transcend’ (cp. § 3) represents
εἶναι ὑπερ τὸ πᾶν. the single art.,
not repeated before ὑπεραιρόμενον,
shews, of course, that the difficulty
lies not in conceiving of the two
things themselves, but in conceiving
their relation to each other. 5. η χρη] in english we say,
’must there not be?’; in greek
there any alternative,) or must there
be?’ 6. καὶ ω π.] καὶ here adds
another description of τὸ μεσον, not
a separate thing; and in τὸ μ. the
art. is used as in τὸ διορίζον just
above. 7. τοῦτο] sc. τὸ μεσον. 8. εφύγομεν] when we asked ποῦ

one form of circumscription.’ 11 the purpose of the digression
was to exemplify the barren dialectic
of the eunomians, as well as to shew
that god is incomprehensible. he is
so, not because he grudges the knowledge
to man, whom he loves. 14. γριφοειδες] from γρῖφος, ‘a

uses it here to bring out the notion

from saying ‘dissolved,’ ‘persihsing’

comes to an end, there is a sense in
which the ‘word’ remains. what

existent. 7. διαθεσεις] in the same way
‘righteousness,’ ‘love,’ are ‘dispositions’

cordingly. 11. τούτων ἀποστ.] the ταῦτα

it is hard to see what gr. means by
this phrase. elias gives an elabo-
rate double explanation which only
shews how much it puzzled him.
prob. by τὸ ποσόν gr. means ’the
’ of motion,—the planets e.g.
moving at a different ‘rate’ from
the fixed stars; while τὸ ποῖον would
include their conjunctions. 5. ὁ τι τύχοιεν εκ. τ ὁρ.] των
ὁρ. depends on ὅ τι; εκ. is in app.
the subj. of τύχ.; ‘any visible any visible ob-
ject which they happened individn-

led by reason to worship, not nature,

son is said to have taken us in hand,
gr. means both the reasonable in-
struction given by the church, and
our own reasonable reflexion upon
it. it is, of course, contrasted with
ὁ πονηρός of the previous section. 6. προσβάλλων] intrans., as in § 6.

intend to connect the clause closely
with κα διὰ τούτων. 8. κάτα την αἴσθ.] things as
much subject to the senses as we are. 10. περίεστιν] ‘they still exist’;
or perhaps, ‘they have existence in
abundance’; cp. § 25. 11. δι’ ἀερος] sc. φερεται. καθ’

like κατὰ γης ’underground’: cp. § 24. 13. τίς η κοινωνία] if this is the
right reading, of course it is ‘what
is this partnership?’ i.e.
came it? if we read τίς κ., κοίν’. κ.
συμφ. κ. συμπν. must be in ap-
position to the τίς before εμιξε, ‘who
combined and distributed them?
what partnership and union and
concord between them? 15. τὸν εἰρηκότα] ‘him who said

that the words which follow are a
direct quotation. nor indeed are
the foregoing, but they seem more
likely to have had their origin in a

had read than the comparatively
colourless words which follow. it is
harder, however, to say, whom gr.

close; but in τἰm. 32 c occur words

was formed of the various elements

gr's language.  θεόν, ὅ τί ποτε μεν εστι την φύσιν καὶ την οὐσίαν,

mean (like plato) that the universe
is conscious of the law by which it
acts. 3. διεξάγεται] seems simply to
mean ‘is conducted.’ cp. in
i 12 διὰ κύκλου τινὸς εὐθύνων καἰ διεφτητι
ἄγων τὸν ἀπάντα κόσμον. 5. τω αὐτομάτω ‘to chance.’ 10. πᾶσι σύμφυτος] notexactly =
εμφυτος, but ‘naturally bound up
with’; like συνημμενος (from
τειν) just after. 17. hereafter we shall know as
we are known; here, the most privileged
attain to a knowledge which is
only relatively great. 15. ἀλλ’ εἰ μεν] but whether man

οὗτος ηλπισεν επικ. τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου

name was beyond the present powers
of enos: he only succeeded τὸ

is of course active in meaning. 11. μετετεθη] gen. v 24; cp.

favour with god μεν), but it did
not of itself prove οὔπω) that e.

attain, an adequate knowledge

with the duty of saving.’ 15. εδικαιωθη] gen. xv 6. 16. θυσίαν θυσίαν gen. xxii 13.
‘strange,’ because miraculously
supplied. it is prob. that gr.
means the ram, rather than isaac;
for basil also makes the ram a type
of christ (de spir. s. 14, p. 319 d). 18. εθρεψε] gen. xviii 8. although
the detail is taken only from ’s
history, the restriction is intended to
apply also to noe. ib. επηνεθη] perh. gen. xviii

this reading has better authority
than οἶκος θ., i.e. bethel. on
the other hand τοῦ ὀφθ. seems more
like a reminiscence of gen. xxxv 1,9
(in u. 7 the word is επεφάνη); and
perh. it might have been more
natural to mention the name of
penuel after the mention of the
wrestling. 6. ητις π. ε.] the whole clause
forms a cogn. ace. after προσπαλ.,
‘wrestles whatever wrestling that of
god with man may be.’ 7. η τάχα] ‘or perhaps (it would
be best to say) the trial,’ etc. he
this turn, because god was
not ’wrestling’ for the mastery, but
to try the ἀρετη of jacob. 8. σύμβολα] gen. xxxii 31 (32). 12. εκεῖνο δε] refers to what follows,
lows, ὅτι θ. φύσιν κτλ. the δε
the apodosis to κλίμακα μεν. ib. ὑπερ αὐτόν] jacob was excelled
by some of his descendants,
but none of them could ’make room
for’ (χωρεῖν), ‘take in,’ or perh.
‘bear,’ the whole of god. 19. elias, esaias, ezekiel, and
others, were unable to receive the
revelation of the divine nature in
itself. 16. η αὔρα τις ὁ] 1 kings xix 12
φωνη αὔρας λεπτης. the τις hints
that there was something more than
usual in ‘that breeze.’ gr.’s agrument
implies that if the presence
had been discerned in the mightier
movements of nature, god might
have been thought to manifest
self wholly in them, but that it was
impossible to imagine this in connexion
with the ‘small breeze.’ 19. 2 εσκιαγράφησεν] εσκιογρ. a || 6 om καὶ f || 10 καίτοιγε] καίτοι c ||

in the book itself. 6. ἀπολωλαμεν] judg. xiii 22—a a
free version. but as gr. quotes the

have found them so in some text. 8. μη ὅτι] cp. ε 11. 9. τω πλοίω μη προσι.] luke v 8.

ὑπόστ. is ‘an establishment’ of some
kind; in 2 sam. xxiii 14 of ‘a garri-
son’; in jer. prob. ‘a court,’ or
‘familiar circle.’ gr. however
curiously misunderstood the word
to = ὑπόστασις in the sense of οὐσία

not merely an incidental privilege.

even admit that we can be sure that

notion of ‘catching hold’ of a thing

(as here) of ‘objections,’ ‘difficulties.’

(iv 25 swete). sw. reads χύμα
καρδίας; and gr.'s χύσις directly

the same, πλάτος being his interpretation.
χύσις, ‘spread,’ ‘expanse.’ 9. ἰλιγγιᾷ] ‘reels.’ ib. τελος τι π. σοφίας] ‘makes it

mean the ‘bottom.’ 5. τεθαυμ] ps. exxxviii (exxxix)
6. ‘that that the knowledge even of his
own constitution was too wonderful

that gr. misunderstood the εξ to
mean that it was the contemplation of
his constitution which
made the knowledge of god seem
overwhelming. 6. κεκρατ.] ibid. εκραταιωθη, οὐ

‘grasp.’ 22. well might david despair;
for how marvellous is man's constitutuion,—his
birth, his sustenance,
his instincts, his continuity, his very
organs and the media in which they
act, a microcosm in himself. 8. φησι] sc. david. 11. κάτω ῥεω] by decay and death:
ἄνω φ., prob. gr. means by contemveys.
ib. ψυχη] without the art., points
the contrast between the nature of
the soul and its limitations. περιγράφεται,
because confined in the
body; 12. ζωην δίδ] sc. to the body;
and yet it receives from the body a
share in its πάθη. 13. ἀόριστος] though our intelligence
works within limits, those
limits are themselves capable of indifinite
extension. 14. εφοδεύων] ‘visiting.’ 15. δι’ ἀερος χ.] perh. by means

which impels the babe to seek its
nourishment, and the provision (lit.
‘distribution’) which supplies the

the breast is meant. αὐτομάτως,
‘instinctively.’ 7. ὁλκη] ‘attraction,’ from ελκειν.
ἵνα is not used here in a ‘final’
sense. cp. § 7. 8. ουνεχηται] sc τὰ γεννωντα κ.
τὰ γεννωμενα. 9. etsrj] ’forms.’ how, gr. asks,
is the common form so constant
while appearing with such a variety
of distinguishing features; and in
all that variety the peculiarities of
each individual remain untouched,
so that no two men are exactly
alike? 11. τὸ αὐτὸ ζωον] ‘animal’ for
‘kind of animal’; as we talk of
’the ’ ’the ’ gr. is speaking
of the deathless persistence of the
species, not of the restored existence
of the specimen. his wonder is
that the type endures. it never
passes into another ζωον. μετα-
στάσει, ‘removal’ by death. 12. ὑπεξηλθε] gnomic aor. 13. ὁλκω] there seems to be no
instance of ὁλκός=ὁλκη, which might
mean the flow or current of the river.
suidas gives an interpretation ὁδὸς
η ἀγωγὸς ῥεύματος, and quotes the
phrase rbv ὁλκὸν τοῦ ὕδατος εκοψεν.
here then it would mean ‘as in the
channel of a river, which (river)
never stands still, yet is ever there.’
this is in accordance with the
common meaning of ὁ. = sulcus. 5 ὑποδεχονται] υπηχουνται b || 12 λόγω λόγων ‘reg. cypr.’ ||

tion of τινες, we see that the word
bore some half-technical sense, of

prob. δοχαί, ὑποδοχαί, ‘receptacles.’ 12. λόγω μη θεωρ.] gr. seems
to mean that the senses, which are
so hospitable to the things external
to ourselves, are yet a mystery imorgans,
penetrable to the reason which
resides within us. 14. μνημης . . . ἀναμνησεως] μν. is
the faculty, ἀνάμν. the act of re-

aristotle bearing the title περὶ μνη-

gr. has in mind. 15. ὁ μικρὸς οὗτος κ.] on man as

and 88 d. these passages have

mr archer-hind, who adds, “no-
thing like the phrase occurs, but the
conception is plainly there." he
thinks it far from improbable that
proclus, whose commentary on this
part of the tim. has not been pre-
served, may have applied the term
μικρὸς κόσμος to the human body;
or that some stoic writer so applied
it.  βούλει σοι καὶ τὰς των ἄλλων ζωων διαφορὰς

it seems an imperfect antithesis to
ἀμφίβια, but prob. gr. means that
the latter class are so little attached
to a place that they are indifferent
even to an element. 18. φιλόκαλα] gr. seems to be
anticipating what he says in § 24
about the peacock; it would not be
easy to point to a quadruped which is
markedly φιλόκαλον unless gr. refers
to such things as the way in which a
cat washes itself. isocrates advises
a man to be φιλόκαλος in regard to
his dress, but not καλλωπιστης, which
he says would be περίεργον. ἀκαλ-
λωπ. cannot mean ‘unadorned,
which would be no antithesis to
φιλόκ., but ‘not given to adorning
themselves.’  σκεψαι μοι καὶ νηκτην φύσιν των ὑδάτων διολισθαίνουσαν, 24. 9 om ἀποχωρησεις καὶ ce || 10 om μικροῦ usque ad ἰδιότητας f || 24. the fish; the fowl. 4. νηκτην φ....διολ.] cp. ε 12.

posing kind? elias is prob. right
referring to the differences between

upon τακτικά; τακτικά is nom.
to εμιμησατο understood, and κιν. κ.
σχ. acc after it. the same verb
must be supplied for ποῖοι φειδίαι etc.
ως φασι implies (as in ε 24) that gr.
himself had not had opportunities of
observing the crane and the peacock.
the usual reading ταῦτα παιδ’. can
only make sense, if at all, if κ. ταῦτα
be taken as in § 19, ’and that, when
they move': ταὐτά makes good sense,
and the καὶ before it points on to
καὶ μετὰ ποικ. ‘what pal. drew up

they tell us, without breaking rank

a passage which gr. has had in view
for some time. 12. ποιότητας] rather a curious
word to join with χάριτας. the
point pern, lies in the plur.; ‘the
charms of the colours and their
varieties of quality.’ 13. πανδαισίᾳ] ‘α perfect feast,’
from δαίς. 15. εὐεργετη] 2nd per. sing. pres.
ind. pass. 18. ἀλλ. κ. τη γη συνδ.] it is
hard to see what gr. means by this
expression. the bays may be said
to be connected with the land by
the way they run up into it and
affect its whole character. gr. is no
doubt thinking of the deeply indented
coast of the aegean. they are con-
nected
with each other, apparently,
because the coasting vessels pass
along from bay to bay, rounding the
headlands, and plying between the
towns that lie in the gulfs. cp. ε 27. 1 συνδεδεμενους de || 2 μόνων a || 5 om καὶ ἀντιτυπούμεναι e || 7 αναρργνυται
b: νυηται e || i 5 o] ω d 3. ὑπὸ γην] a special feature of
asia minor. σηραγγες are ’holes?
’passages, gr.'s theory of hot
springs is that the water is heated
by the violence with which it is
forced out of its underground pas-
sages, by blasts of air which it en-
counters. these dash it from side
to side and drive it with intense
pressure through narrow apertures,
until it assumes a very high temperature
εκπυρούμεναι). ὅπη παρείκοι,
‘wherever possuble.' i do not
know whence gr. obtained this
theory. it is not in arist. meteor.
or de mnndo, although arist. has
much to say about underground
currents of wind, as well as of underground
streams. arist. rightly connects
hot springs with volcanic action.
but cp. bas. hex. iv εκ της αὐτης
τοῦ κινοῦντος αἰτίας ζεουσα γίνεται...
καὶ πυρωδης. 8. μ. τ. εναντίας δ.] generally
understood to mean ’along with the
’ this is of course an impossible
interp. of the words. the
μετὰ is, as frequently in gr., used in
that general sense which includes
the instrumental, — like its modern
representative με; cp. ε 13 σκοπεῖ
μετὰ της ἰδ’. ἀσθενείας, § 2 i προσβ.
μετὰ των αἰσθησεων, ε 28 μεθ’ οὗ
λόγος. so here it will mean ‘with
their contrary (i. e. corrective) force.' 10. ἄτεχνον ὕφ’.] a kind of oxymoron.
gr. uses ὑφαίνειν in a wide
way, without any notion of ‘weaving';
e.g. § 24 συνυφαίνων την ωδην. 11. επαινετά] agrees with ταῦτα,
the question τί τὸ μεγα κτλ. being
parenthetical. της σχες. depends on
επαιν., ’ to be praised for, in reference

prob. no direct ref. to the shell-fish
called a nautilus, which only bears
that name because of its similarity
to a man in a sailing boat. by ’the
land ’’ gr. means the land
animal which nevertheless finds a
home on the sea. at the same time
the word ναυτίλος had become so
exclusively poetical as applied to
men and ships, and so recognised a
name for the shell-fish, that the ad-
dition of χ. was necessary to prevent
a moment's mistake. ἄγει sc. η

waters fed?’ the metaphor
more ’luxuriant’ in greek than in
english, and gr. proceeds, with an
apology, to develope it. some of
them, he says, are ’watered from
above,’ i.e. are fed by
others (and this is the climax of the
’luxuriance’) ’drink with their roots?
i.e. are fed by springs from under-
ground. these last gr. had learned

will not pronounce upon the ques-
tion whether the heavenly φύσις,
i.e. the angels, are incorporeal or

law of their original creation.’ to
’make’ the angels winds suggests a
change in their mode of existence;
but gr. thinks that it may denote
what is contained in the original act
of creation, and not something sub-
sequent. 8. ἀκούει] audit, ’it is called.’ 9. της π. οὐσίας] sc. θεοῦ; cp. § 7. 11. ἰλιγγιωμεν] cp. § 21. 13. λαμπρότητας, ἀναβάσεις] it

ἀνάβασις is a strange designation
for a personal being, and, if it
not for the ν. δὺν. which follows, it
might have been thought that gr.
had turned from the angelic beings
