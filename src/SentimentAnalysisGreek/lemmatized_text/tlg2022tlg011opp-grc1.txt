differ on most points but agree on

ghost is difficult. controversialists
defeated over the son attack the holy
ghost the more eagerly. good christians,
sick of argument, wish the
enquiry left alone. but we must
try. i shall not discuss the meaning
of ‘ holy ’ and of ‘ spirit, ’ of of the
two words together. that has been
done by others. 3. οἱ ἄνθρωποι] the clause χρη
γάρ τι κτλ., as well as the opposed
ἀλλ’ ὅτι καὶ ημεῖς, shows that gr.
does not mean 'men,' including
good christians who dislike controversy,
but ’the men,' i.e. his
opponents. their very failure, and
the exhaustion of their arguments
about the son ἀποκαμόντες), make
them the more keen in their attack
upon the spirit. 6. ἀποκναισθεντες] cp. i 2. 7. κακοσίτοις] ’squeamish about
their diet.’ ib. ot επειδὰν κτλ.] the mss.
appear to give no sign of any other
reading, but the grammar is in hopeless
confusion. the simplest remedy
would be to strike out οἳ before
επειδάν, and to insert it before πρὸς
πάντα. otherwise we must suppose
that some words have fallen out
after ἀηδισθωσι, such as πάντα ἀποστρεφονται,
followed by ημεῖς οὖν to
begin a new sentence. the required
sense is plain, though it cannot be
got out of the present text : that as
people of delicate stomach, who
have had something offered them
which they dislike, turn against food
in general, so we, disgusted with
the eunomian arguments about the
son, are disinclined to listen to
arguments of any kind about the
spirit, or indeed on any religious
subject. 9. ὁ λόγος δραμεῖται] 1 thess.

επεί, where perh. we might have
expected ως, seems to be in favour
of the reading ταὐτά, which would
thus be taken to mean, ’since we
agree with ’ but the mss.
are not of very great value in matters
of this kind (and it must be remembered
that the principal ms. fails us
at this point) ; and it would be difficult
to supply a verb that would
suit ταὐτά, which the obvious φιλοσοφοῦμεν
would not do. επεὶ will
therefore indicate that the proposed
division of labour is a fair one : the
ετεροι (by whom gr. prob. means,
not basil, but students who wer
still living to profit by his labours),
have worked at that particular study
for our advantage as well as their
own, and we will leave it to them,

gr. means the holy ghost. 7. η γὰρ ἄλλη τις] besides the superior
ms. authority for η, it accords
better with the καἰ before η τις,
which would be unintelligible with

interpose the question with λαὶ before

there was no agreement among them

are divided. while some believe him
to be god, some think him α divine
operation, or even α creature; some
make nice distinctions between his
nature and those of the father and
son. 14. μικρὸν ἄνωθεν] ‘a little farther

not involve the denial of the holy

id. ελληνων δε οἱ θ.] no doubt
esp. plato and aristotle. if the
actual expression νοῦς τοῦ παντός does

χάρις appears to be used in the sense
which lidd. and scott put as iv 2
viz. ‘homage due,’ ‘majesty’; and
τάξις accordingly will be, not exactly
the order in which the names
stand in the bible, but the rank
which is inherent in each. ‘who
think that the rank and dignity of
the respective names denotes a gradation
of the realities which they
represent.’ the πράγματα, of course,
are the three blessed persons themselves. 6. against sadducee and greek
i shall not indulge myself to argue,
but only against the others. the
holy ghost is either a contingent or
a substantive existence. if contingent,
he must be a divine operation or
influence; but this does not agree
with the personal language of scripture.
if he is a substantive existence,
he is either god or a creature;
there is no betwixt and between. if
he is a creature, how can we ‘believe
in’ him? he must be god. 8. ἁμαρτ. ελαίω] ps. cxl (cxli) 5.
it may be asked, why it would be
an anointing of himself with the oil
of sinners for his oration to enter into
controversy with such persons, while
he feels himself at liberty to argue
with the macedonians. the answer
is, that the ἁμαρτωλοὶ are not opponents
(as the donatists might have
said) too bad even to be argued
with. he means that, although it
might add a richness and profusion
to his discourse, there would be a
kind of sinful self-indulgence in
demolishing opinions with which
he was not practically confronted. 9. των καθ’ εατυτὸ ὑφ.] ‘either an
independent subsistence, or a thing
observed in something else.’ 12. συμβεβηκός] something contingent,
‘a contingency’; a thing which
happens to be so, but might have
been otherwise. 13. ενεργεια τοῦτο ἂν εἴη θ.] ‘it (the
holy spirit so conceived of) will be
an operation of god’— an influence,
an inspiration, or the like—‘for
what else could it be, or from whom
besides could it come?’ 1 και ει] om ει b || 2 τω] το b || 7 υπολειφθησεται ‘or. 1’ 1. φεύγει σύνθεσιν] it is assumed
that all will agree that the simpler
the account, the better. 2. ενεργηθησεται . . . παύσεται] the
fut. is logical, not temporal. it is
of the very nature of an ‘operation ’
to be incapable of independent
action, or to continue when the
operator stops. 3. πως οὖν ενεργεῖ] the bible,
however, attributes to the holy
spirit operations of his own, such
as ‘saying’ this and that (τάδε),
‘separating’ (an inexact reminiscence
of acts xiii 2). 4. λυπεῖται] eph. iv 30. 5. παροξύνεται] is. lxiii 10. ib. κινουμενου] middle voice.
these are notes, gr. says, not of
a motion in the abstract (such as an
ενεργεια is), but of the thing which
is in motion. 6. των περὶ την οὐ.] ‘an existence,
and not an attribute of
existence.’ 9. τραγελάφους] the typical fabulous
compound. 10. τελειούμεθα] in baptism; cp.
§ 29. ib. οὐ γὰρ ταὐτόν] ‘it is not the same
thing to believe in anything, and to
believe statements about it; the first
is peculiar to god, the second can be
done with any thing.’ see pearson
on the creed i believe in god; who
rightly says that the distinction is
more characteristic of western than
of eastern theology. 13. οὐδε ποίημα] sc. εστί. the apodosis
begins at this point, not at ἀλλ᾿
οὐ κτίσμα. 7. now it is your turn. ‘is he
begotten, or unbegotten? if begotten,
of whom ? if of the father, there
are two sons; if of the son, he is
a grandson.’ your names do not
terrify me. because we are obliged
to speak of ‘sonship’ in the godhead,
it does not follow that all earthly
nomenclature would apply; or at
that rate you will have to say ali
manner of strange things.  ενταῦθα σὸς ὁ λόγος ’ αἱ σφενδόναι πεμπεσθωσαν,

interpolation into his adversary's
argument. 7. φιλοσωματος] i.e. determined
to refer everything to material standards. 9. σοφοὶ τοῦ κακ’.] jer. iv 22. it
is hard to see why gr. balances this
clause by ‘ and will not write what
is good.' it is not a reference to
anything in scripture. no doubt
the eunomian literature was as extensive
as its oral polemic. 11. τὰ πράγματα] much as at the
end of § 5. the ’names’ which he
says would not scare him ὅσ’ are
such as that of υἱωνός. not that he
admits that such a name would
necessarily be applicable, even if
the ‘ facts ’ were as suggested.
is shewn in the next sentence. 12. κατά τινα σχ. ὑψ.] ‘according
to sonic relationship too lofty for us
to understand' the son is son. no
other language would express at
once his derivation from the father
and his being of one substance with
him. it does not follow, however,
that all the nomenclature of our
earthly relationships is to be trans-
ferred straightway to the godhead. 20. εἰ δε σοι κ· τοῦτο π·] ’and if

gr. uses his name with that of
valentinus to denote in contemptuous
indifference gnosticism in
general ; or perh. he confuses marcion
with marcus, the disciple of
val., from whom the marcosians
take their name. ib. θεὸς ἀρρενόθηλυς] gr. does not
mean that val. taught that god was
ἀρρ., but only compares the god
who has just been imagined with

father, but he is all that the father
is. ib. δτι εκ τοῦ θ.] the fact that
he is of the father's essence (1 cor.
ii 12) does not make him son. 8. εν τὰ τρία τη θ.] the three
(gr. again avoids the masc.) are
one — an undivided unit — in their
nature; the one is three — a trinity
— in the ineffaceable distinction
between the persons. the latter
observation removes the sabellian
conception of the unity ; the former
removes the eunomian division of
the natures. in the construction of
the last clause, της π. ν. διαιρεσεως
is the predicate after η understood,
like οὐκ ελλείψεως above. 10 you are surprised at our
calling him god, consubstantial with
the father. he must be so if there
is only god god and one godhead. i
am ashamed to use earthly illustrations;
but even in natural history
there are very different modes of reproduction
which it might help you
to consider. 12. δὸς οὖν μοι] the word διδόναι
is not used here in its frequent
sense of a logical concession ; for it
would be no concession to the
eunomians to ’give’ what is here
required. it means rather, ’shew
me’ ‘convince me that it is so.’ the
eunomian offers, if convinced that
two consubstantial persons issue from
the same divine source, to acknow-
ledge each of them to be a god.
gr. illustrates the illogical character
of the offer by a counter-paralogism.
‘shew me,’ he says, ‘that there is
than one sort of god, and i
will shew you the same trinity that
we now believe in, name and thing.’
it is as unreasonable to deduce
ditheism or tritheism from the
catholic doctrine of the relation of
the son and spirit to the father, as
it would be to deduce the catholic
doctrine of the trinity from a belief
in godheads of varying quality. 10. 1 δεχομαι] + καὶ c || 2 ἄλλον θεον dfg || 4 εἰς θεὸς μία φυσις] εἰς ο

be propagated by ‘cuttings’ as well
as by ‘seed.’ 4. τω παρόντι] ‘the case in point,’

that ‘worshipping or praying in or
by the spirit,’ which are clearly
commanded, are in fact the bringing
of prayer and worship by the spirit
to himself. this is based upon the
text first quoted, in which the object
of the worship πνεῦμά εστιν. not
that gr. definitely takes the first
πνεῦμα in that text to be the holy
ghost ; but on the principle that
worship offered to one person of the
trinity is offered to all, his reasoning
is correct, if his premisses are
accepted. it must be owned, however,
that he somewhat begs the
question. 7. πάντα διὰ τοῦ υἱ.] john i 3. 11. τω υἱω δός] ‘assign assign him to the

and are more or less right-minded

that which comes next — only to the
latter. 14. τί φατε] ‘what do you say

you call tritheists, which will not

formed on the model of λόγος σοφίας,
γνωσεως, 1 cor. xii 8. 10. ὑμῖν τοῖς κ. σ. χρ.] ‘by the

thus. there is but one god, and
one godhead; and though there are
three persons, there is but one source
from which all that belongs to the
godhead issues. between these three
persons there is no kind οἱ division
or inequality, as there is between the
specimens of a limited class. 13. εἷς θεός, ὅτι μ. θ.] ‘there is
but one god, because there is only
one thing that can be called godhead.’
if there could be different
kinds of godhead, we might imagine
many gods; but as the thing
is necessarily unique, we cannot
conceive of it as the possession of
several personages independent
each other. this argument, of
course, is based on philosophical
grounds, not on divine revelation ;
but it bears witness to the reasonadvocacy
ableness of that revelation. ib. πρὸς εν τὰ εξ αὐτοῦ] cp. iii
2 πρὸς τὸ εν των εξ αὐτοῦ σύννευσις.

resides, and which issue from the
first cause, deriving from it their
existence above all time and with
an equality of glory, there are
three objects for our adoration.’
avoids saying τρεῖς οἱ προσκ., not
only, as so freq., for the sake of
reverence, but because it sounds at
first as if the three were ‘separate
individualities’ like ourselves.
also has its dangers, as possibly suggesting
differences of nature ; but in
the context this danger is removed.
it is possible that gr. here means
to speak of the father himself as εκ
της πρωτης αἰτίας; but. if so, that
πρωτη αἰτία is within himself. he
is the source of his own being. 15. the greeks, it is true, spoke
of α single divine nature, compatible
with plurality ; ἃς is the case
also with human nature. but in
these cases, each individual has but
a fragment of the whole nature,
varies, not only from all other partakers
of it, but from himself also, by
change. this holds true even of
angels. 13. μόνον επινοίᾳ θ.] in the case
of the heathen polytheism, the common
godhead exists only as a conception
or generalisation of the
philosopher; it has no existence in
fact. each individual deity differs
greatly from the other in history,
and character, and capacities. the
same holds true of the specimen
man in relation to the human genus.  οἵ τε παρ’ ελληνων σεβόμενοι θεοί τε καὶ

and in character. 7. φύσις η ἄνω μετὰ τ. τ.] cp.

the whole section should be compared
with this passage. 16. the divisions among the

be called three at all, it can only be
as three gods ; that is, your doctrine
is incurably tritheistic ours
is not, he adds ; for we deny the

god and mammon are not actually
described as two masters, and that
if they were, it would be ἃς masters
that they would be numbered together,
in which respect they are
alike. 19. if you tell me that numbers
denote things of one nature and those
only, then i will deny that you can
say ‘three men,’ unless each
three is an exact repetition of the
others. st john was certainly not
bound by your rule when he spoke of
the three witnesses nor will it
when you come to speak of things
of different natures but bearing the
same name. 16. οἷς συνεκφ. καταλλ. κ. τ. ὀ.]
the opponent explains that
things ranged under a number, because
they are of the same nature.
he means cases where the noun is
expressed and the numeral agrees
with it (oἷς i.e. συναριθμουμενοις
practically = ‘ the numeral’), like
‘three men,’ ‘three god.’ he does
not mean that you can never lump
together under a neuter numeral
heterogeneous objects as so many
‘things.’ this, he says, is not a
connumeration. 19. 1 καὶ θεοι] om καὶ b || 5 παυλοι... πετροι transp. def || 6 λεγονται

‘what,’ he asks, ‘shall i make you

implies a suppressed ‘take care!’ ib. τοῦτο νομοθ. εστι] ‘this,’
gr. retorts, ‘is to legislate for ian-
guage, not to state the facts with

refuse to admit that peter and paul
and john are three beings of the
same nature ; he may say that
unless all the peculiarities of
are exactly reproduced, so that
there are three peters, there is not
sufficient correspondence between
peter and the others to warrant
their being brought under a single
number as three men. 6. γενικωτερων] ‘generic’ as opexplanied

merely ‘understood.’ or. means
both in the case of ὁμοούσια which
are not numbered together, and in
that of οὐχ ὁμοούσια which are. 20. it will not bear the simplest
test of addition or division. your
rules about the order of enumeration,
and about the use of prepositions,
are just as ridiculous. we will
now proceed to give you the coup de
grace. 13. οὐκ εἰς δύο συντ.] ‘one and
one make two,’ although ace. to the
heretic’s logic ‘one and one’ would
only be said of things of different
nature, such as could never be
united under a common numeral.
conversely ‘two is divided into one
and οne,’ although ‘two’ can only
be said of things of the same nature,
which it would be unnatural to
describe in that single fashion. the
upshot is that the same things
proved to be of the same nature and
of different natures. of course the
argument is more or less of a piece
of banter. 17. προαριθμ. κ. ὑπαριθμ.] elias
says, probably without historical
grounds, that this system of numbering
(δεύτερος θεός, τρίτος θεός)
was derived from the way in which
the neoplatonic writers arranged
existences according to a scale, from
the first cause to the lowest. the
phraseology is fully discussed by
basil l. c. (de sp. s. 17.)῾υπαριθμεῖν’,
as distinguished from συναριθμ.,

e.g. 2 cor. xiii 14. 6. π. της θεὸς φ. καὶ κύριος]
‘the same observation holds good’

basil de sp. s. 2 ascribes the canon

‘hidden’ like a treasure, = ἀπόκρυφον.

fact that he is not very clearly,

dispensation; ὕστ., under the later. 15. λύσομεν…βλάβην] ‘will remove
this disadvantage’; said
a kind of irony, as if the opponent
would recognise that it was a βλάβη.  των πραγμάτων τὰ μεν οὐκ εστι, λεγεται δε· τὰ

which we may arrange the phenomena
of scripture language, (i)
there are things said which are not
literally true. of this kind are all
the anthropomorphic expressions concerning
god. 1. λεγεται δε] sc. in scripture. 4. ὑπνοῖ] ps. xliii 24 (xliv 23). 5. γρηγορεῖ] jer. xxxi 28. id. ὀργίζεται] e.g. ps. lxxviii
(lxxix) 5. ib. βαδίζει] the word does not
seem to be used of god in lxx.
the ref. is doubtless to passages
like gen. iii 8. ib. θρόνον εχει] ps. lxxix 2 (lxxx 1);
ezek. i 26. 6. εμπαθης] in ref. to ὑπνοῖ,
γρηγορεῖ, ὀργίζεται; σωμα, to βαδίζει,
θρόνον. 9. ηρεμεῖν … ἀφ’ ημ’.] ‘letting
alone’ (lit. ‘keeping quiet from us’). 11. ἀθρόως] ‘suddenly; cp. ii 2. 15. τηδε. … τηδε] ‘in this direction
and in that.’ 17. ταῖς ἃγ. δυνάμεσι] sc. τοῖς
χερουβίμ. ‘resting in those holy
powers and, as it were, being fond
of the place, is “sitting” and “being
enthroned”.’ 18. οὐδενὶ γάρ] the γάρ explains,
not the καὶ τοῦτο ημ’., but the choice
of the expression ‘resting’ etc. god
is in everything; but there is nothing
in which he ‘rests’ as he does in
the saints (and angelic beings). 19. τὸ δε ὀξυκ.] more instances of
metaphorical language. god ‘flies,’
ps. xvii li (xviii 10); we speak of
his ‘face,’ e.g. ps. iv 7 (6); his
‘hand,’ e.g. ps. cxliv (cxlv) 16.  πάλιν σὺ πόθεν τὸ ἀγεννητον λαβων εχεις, η τὸ 23. 6 om η e2 || 7 ὀνομαστὶ] + καὶ η ἀθετησομεν επειδη οὐ γεγραπται

i.e. ‘has suggested the form of.’
should almost have expected the
inversion of the sentence, — that
bodily things depict the powers and
operations of god; but either way
is intelligible. 23. (2) there are th ings not said
which are nevertheless true, — among
them facts of which you make a
deal. (3) things neither said nor
true. (4) things both true and said. 5. πάλιν] instances of true
things not found in scripture. 6. τὰς σὰς ἀκροπ.] ‘those fortresses
of yours’; cp. below τοῦ
της καταφυγης. 7. η διαγράψομεν] cp. iii 8. the
words η ἀθετησομεν, επειδη οὐ γεγραπται
seem to be an ancient gloss
to explain η διαγράψομεν. they
offer no real alternative to it ; and
the variation of the mss. which contain
them between η and καὶ η indicates
the uncertainty of their footing.
if they are to be retained, the only
sense that can be got out of them
would be this: — shew us the words
ἀγεννητον, ἄναρχον in the bible, and
we will either reject the holy
ghost’s divinity for not being found
there, or (if we can prove that it is
there) we will erase both it and your
two words together. but this would
be very cumbrous. omitting the
words, the sense is plain. gr. retaliates
; — shew us ἀγενν., ἄναρχ. in
the bible, or we will discard them,
and you will die by your own rules.
the perf. τεθνηκας gives vividness
to the argument. probably the
gloss was introduced because gr. ’s
word διαγράψομεν seemed itself to
imply that the words ἀγεννητον etc.
were to be found written in scripture.
how can that be erased which
was never written? the scribe
wished to substitute for διαγρ. the
more general word ἀθετησομεν, ‘because
the expressions in question
are not written.’ it may be
that the correction might be
due to gr. himself; but (1) its place
in the mss. is against it; it ought to
have followed διαγρ.; (2) by διαγρ.
gr. intended no reference to being
found in scripture ; he meant, if
conscious of the metaphor at all, an
erasure from the theological writings
in which the expressions occurred. 8. των ὀνομάτων] sc. ἀγεννητον,

these facts, and have (rightly) deduced
from them the appellations

that are said and are not, and things
that are and are not said. 10. τὸ παρελθὸν ενεστ’.] ‘past is

opinion that it is so.’ the η
mean ‘or at any rate.’ 14. θεός, ἄνθρ., κτλ.] gr. first
names four substantives, and then
certain propositions ; ‘such syllo-
gisms are vanity, and a
of faith, and an emptying of the
mystery? see 1 cor. i 17 foll. 24. this being so, we must not
make too much of the reticence
scripture. when you hear of twice
five, you are justified in saying ten ;
so whatever is clearly implied in
scripture may rightly be affirmed,
even if it is not explicitly stated
there. i will give you the reason for
the reticence of scripture.  τοσαύτης οὖν οὔσης διαφορᾶς εν τοῖς ὀνόμασι καὶ

other hand, de sp. s. 1, points out
the extreme importance of noticing

the spirit.  δύο γεγόνασι μεταθεσεις βίων επιφανεῖς εκ τοῦ

the bible on the subject of the

‘although you are so wise as to need
no instruction.’ 2. ἀναγαγων] ‘going some distance
back’; not back over the preargument,
but to principles
somewhat remote from the conclusion. 25. two great changes have occurred
in the history of religion,
when inert passed under the first and
second covenants respectively. in
neither case was the change violently
made. like a skilled teacher or
physician, god made the new order
agreeable by permitting for a while
something from the old, until mem
were ready to give it up of themselves. 3. μεταθεσεις βίων] he calls
two dispensations by this title, because
he is about to dwell on the
practical difficulties attending such
transitions. 4. σεισμοὶ γης] the ref. is to
heb. xii 26. 5. διὰ τὸ...περιβόητον] ‘because
of the celebrity of the thing,’
cause the change was so great and
on such a scale as to compel
wide attention. 7. εντεῦθεν ... εκεῖσε] from the
present order to that which is beyond. 9. μηδε’ σαλευόμενα] heb. xii 28. 10. ἀθρόως] cp. § 22. 12. τὸ μεν γὰρ ἅκ. οὐδε μόνιμον]
‘for what is not voluntary is not
lasting either.’ 15. τὸ μεν τοῦ βίας.] in the one
instance, the change would be
the work of him who forced it on ;
in the other, it is our own. the one
kind of change is in keeping with
the the considerateness of god ; the
other would be a mark of tyrannical
power. 7 μακρω] των μακρω b : τω μακρω def 2. τὸ μεν ὑφαῖρει] ‘like α school-
master or physician, he withdraws
some parts of the hereditary system,
and leaves others as α concession,
giving in upon some small points
which tend to keep men happy.’ 5. φαρματτ. τοῖς χρηστ.] ‘being
seasoned with something nicer’ than
itself. the rhythm of the sentence
is in favour of joining διὰ της τεχνης
to παραδεχθη rather than to φαρμ. 6. ῥᾴστη] used as an equivalent
to the simple ῥᾳδία. 7. μακρω χρόνω cp. ii 14. 8. τὰς θυσίας σνεχ.] this, which
is the usual patristic view of the legal
sacrifices, is well expressed by cyr.
al. c. iul. iv p. 126 (aubert) ; and
by greg, the great in his letter to
mellitus (bede hist. eccl. i 30). 10. εδεξαντο την ὑφ.] ‘as soon as
they were reconciled to the with-
drawal, they conceded the concession
that had been made to them.’ it is
not clear at what point gr. means
that the jews ‘conceded’ the sacrifaces.
it ought, ace. to the parallelism,
to mean when ‘they became
jews instead of heathens,’ as
gave up circumcision when they
‘became christians instead of jews.’
this, however, would only be
of special representatives of the race,
like samuel and other prophets and
psalmists, who taught that obedi-
ence was better than sacrifice. if
gr. is not thinking of these, we
must suppose that the time when
they gave up the sacrifices was
practically the same as when they
gave up circumcision, i.e. not when
they first became ‘jews,’ but when
they became christians. 13. κλαπεντες] for the use of
κλεπτειν cp. i 2. 14. εκ τοῦ περιτ. καἰ ἅγν’.] acts
xvi 3, xxi 26. 16. εγω δε, ἀδελφοί] gal. v. 11.
probably gr. does not mean that this
was an advance in st paul’s
views. he can hardly have failed
to know that the ep. to the gal.
was written before the incident in
acts xxi 26. he only means
we see st paul sometimes acting on
the principle of οἰκονομία, i.e. departure
from what is absolutely best,
out of consideration for the circumstances
of others, and sometimes on
the principle of τελειότης.  τούτω τὸ της θεολογίας εἰκάζειν εχω, πλην ὅσον
εκ των εναντίων. εκεῖ μεν γὰρ εκ των ὑφαιρεσεων η
μετάθεσις· ενταῦθα δε διὰ των προσθηκων η τελείωσις.

of god, except that the successive
changes have been in the direction of
believing more truths, not fewer.
when the doctrine of the father was
well established, that of the son was
revealed, and when that was accepted,
then the doctrine of the
spirit. the spirit himself came
by degrees. christ himself revealed
him only by slow advances. 1. της της θεολογίας] ‘the doctrine of
god.’ ib. πλην ὅσον εκ των εν.] ‘except
that it follows the opposite order.’
the change of practical system consists
in dropping things; the doctrinal
change consists in learning
additional truths. 6. εμπολιτεύεται] ‘is resident
and active among us.’ gr.
that the church learns by
experience how to interpret the
slight indications of the holy ghost’s
divinity given by the n.t. it does
not follow that he thought doctrinal
advance possible in other directions
also. 11. επιφορτίζεσθαι] ‘to be piled on
the top of it,’ as an additional

disciples by degrees, dealing himself
out to them in proportion to the capacity
of the recipients.’ 3. εν ἀρχη τοῦ εὑ.] the two
series, of three members each, cor

gospel,’ he ‘performs miracles
through the disciples (luke ix ι)
‘after the passion,’ he is ’breathed
upon’ the disciples (john χχ 22)
‘after after the going up,’ he ‘revealed
himself in fiery tongues’ (acts ii 3)
the same profectus apostolicus is
traced in or. xli 11, and by gr.’s
secretary jerome ad hedib. 7. εντυγχάνων] ‘perusing’; cp.
§ 21. the progress in our lord’s
statements about the holy ghost is
traced in four sayings. ib. ερωτησω] john xiv 16. 9. ἀντίθεος] cp. iv 5. jesus
might have seemed to be setting
himself up as a kind of rival god,
and to speak as if by some independent
authority, if he had not in
the first instance referred the mission
of the holy ghost entirely to the
father. 10. εἶτα, πεμψει μεν] john xiv
26. here, though the ‘mission’ is
still referred to the father, the son’s
request is dropped, and the spirit
is said to be sent ‘in his name.’ 12. εἶτα, πεμψω] john xv 26.
here the son’s personal dignity is
revealed, as himself the sender of
the spirit. gr. of course is not directly
rectly speaking of the eternal
procession. ib. εἶτα, ηξει] john xvi 7 (ελθη).
here the spirit’s own freedom
brought out. it is a correct and
useful observation. 2 om τὸ μεν γὰρ ἄτεχνον τὸ ’δε ἄθεον καὶ b || 5 ηλθε τισιν επι νοῦν ηδη d :

— not to keep things back, but
not to teach them till people are
prepared. perhaps one of the things
which the disciples could not bear
while christ was with them, but
were to learn afterwards from the
spirit, was this very doctrine of the
spirit’s godhead. 1. καὶ ημᾶς] as well as our
saviour. τάξιν is ace. after δρᾷς,

luke xxiv 41. 16. εἴπερ τι μεγα οἴ. χρη] ‘if we
may call anything which is promised
or taught great.’ it implies a
of appreciation, greater than we perhaps
possess, to determine the degrees
of greatness in what god
promises or reveals.  εχω μεν οὕτω περὶ τούτων, καὶ εχοιμι, καὶ ὅς τις

to worship in one godhead three
undivided persons. woe to him
zoho does not hold it, or who shifts
with the public opinion of the times.
if the holy ghost gives us the divine
nature, he must needs be an
object of worship, and in the full
sense divine. 3. εχω μεν οὕτω] ‘that is how
i stand’: explained, with no
construction, by σεβειν. 4. θεὸν τὸν πατερα] ‘the father

christianity. 6. των μικρω πρ. θεοφόρων] acc.

distinction is not always observed. 14. η χρυση τις] in rough apposition
to εν. it is difficult to decide
between this reading and χρυσῖτις,
which has the authority of the best

it seems natural to choose the
rarer word ; but on the other hand
the scribe of ‘a’ may have been

seems strange to add καὶ γεννησεως

doubt, that to orthodox christians

qualify the preceding adjectives,

change in him. θεσις seems to be
used in the sense of ‘agreement,’
‘arrangement,’ in which sense it
is contrasted with φύσις by other
writers. from this general sense
of ‘agreement,’ it comes to be used
of ‘adoption’ into a family, or
‘admission’ to the citizenship of a
city. 10. ἁγιάζον] e.g. rom. xv 16

θεοποιοῦν, constructively deduced
from the sourut’s action in baptism ;
τελειοῦν, in the ‘mystical’ sense of
‘initiating.’ all three words have
ref. to ‘baptism,’ in the larger sense
of the word ; and the ωστε prob.
belongs to all three. it is more
difficult to say what gr. means by
this use of ωστε. prob. it is intended
to shew that the spirit’s
part in baptism is an active, and
not a passive part, so as to justify
gr.’s attribution to him of
work of ‘making’ us temples etc.
his independence with respect to
the sacrament is a proof of this.
he is able to ‘anticipate baptism’
(acts x 44) ; and ‘baptism’ may be
received and his indwelling be yet
to seek (acts viii 16). 8. ενεργοῦν] 1 cor. xii 11; μερὶ.

compared with 1 cor. xii 4 foll.,
rom. xii 6, acts xx 28. 10. νοερὸν κτλ.] the following
list is taken from wisd. vii 22 foll.,
which describes the ‘spirit’ which
‘is in wisdom.’ gr. does not
all the epithets there used, some of
which, esp. μονογενες, would have
been troublesome for him to expound.
each epithet from νοερὸν
to ἀμόλυντον is explained. νοερόν
= σοφωτατον ; πολυμερες =
ταῖς ενεργ. ; σαφες = σαφηνιστικὸν
πάντων (neut.) ; τρανόν = τρανωτικόν ;
ἀκωλυτον = αὐτεξούσιον (this shews
the order of df to be wrong) ;
ἀμόλυντον = ἀναλλοίωτον (since
change in the holy ghost must be a
change for the worse).  οἱ ταῦτα λεγοντες καὶ διδάσκοντες, καὶ πρός
ἄλλον παράκλητον, οἷον ἄλλον θεόν, ὀνομάζοντες, οἱ την
εἰς αὐτὸ βλασφημίαν μόνην εἰδότες ἀσυγχωρητον, οἱ τὸν 5 ταὐτὸ] ταὐτὸν cdef: τοῦτο ‘or. ι’ 30. 8 πρὸς γε] προσετι γε b:

wisd. vii 23. the ‘understanding,
pure, and most subtle spirits’ in
wisd. ‘through’ which the spirit
‘goes,’ are, in gr.’s opinion (no
doubt correct), not only ‘the angelic
powers,’ but also the spirits of prophets
and apostles. these the holy
spirit penetrates κατὰ ταὐτό, ‘simultabeously,’
although they are distributed
in many different places, which
is a proof that he is infinite. 30. such sayings involve his
godhead. all language of α different
kind is explained by the principle
of referring all to the father as the
first cause. 8. οἱ ταῦτα λεγοντες] viz. the
sacred writers who used such ianguage
about the holy spirit. ib. πρός γε] adv. ‘besides.’ 9. οἶον ἄλλον θ.] the words have
a dangerous sound; ‘as it were
another god.’ but gr. does not
mean to call him so. he
means that to call him a paraclete
at all, in the same sense as
is equivalent to calling him god. 10. μόνην εἰδότες ἀσυγχ] matt.
xii 31 foll. 11. στηλιτεύσαντες] the greek
method of proclaiming something
to the honour or infamy of a person
was to ‘post’ it on a στηλη or post
in some publc place. hence a person
subjected to such infamy is
described in class. greek as στηλίτης;
from whence comes the
στηλιτεύειν. 12. εψεύσ…ως θεόν] acts v 3 foll. 14. ως λίαν] ‘since you really
are a very stupid person. 15. πόρρω τοῦ πν] like ἀλλότριοι

for the most part only given allusively.
what gr. means by επὶ των
ῥ may be seen in iii 17. 2. ὅσα δε κἀνταῦθα] i.e. as well
as in the case of the son. see iii 18. 3. δίδοσθαι] e.g. luke xi 13

luke xxiv 49, acts i 4 ; ὑπερεντευξις
(cp. iv 14), rom. viii 26. 6. ἀνενεκτεον] from ἀναφερω,
‘must be referred to the primal
cause, in order that it may be shewn
from whom he proceeds.’ 7. παραδεχθωσιν] the correlative
to παραδίδοσθαι ; ‘that men might
not receive the polytheistic doctrine
of three separate sources, or first
principles.’ 9. τὸ μεν τω προσωπω] lit. ‘it
counts for the same in impiety,
whether you join like sabellius, or
disjoin like the arians, — the former
in the person, the latter in the natures.’
gr. seems instinctively to
say τω προσωπω, not τοῖς προσωποις,
because sabellianism reduces the
persons to one, — if indeed any personality
can be said to remain. 31. illustrations of the doctrine
of the trinity are wholly inadequate ;
like mouth, spring, and stream. 10. ως εγ. π.] ‘how many things!’ 11. πανταχόθεν] cp. πολυπρ. ii 9. ib. πανταχόθεν] where the english
mode of thought would have
expected πανταχόσε. 13. ω τινὶ χρη των κ.] ‘to what
earthly thing i might compare.’ 14. τὸ πλεῖον] ‘the the most improtant
part escapes me, leaving me below
with my illustration.’ 15. ὀφθαλμόν] the context makes
it unquestionable that elias is right
in interpreting the word to mean
what is called ὀπη in james iii 11, —
the ‘mouth’ out of which the spring
issues. no other example of this
usage seems to be known; but gr.’s
own language in his poem about
the holy ghost (iii 60) leaves no
room for doubt. he there rejects
the same comparison of πόρος, πηγη,
ποταμὸς μεγας, εν τε ῥεεθρον. it is
just possible that gr. was aware
that an ‘eye’ is the ordinary word
in hebrew for a spring; but in any
case the metaphor is so natural that
it is prob. an accident that we do
not find it oftener.  πάλιν ηλιον ενεθυμηθην, καὶ ἀκτῖνα, καὶ φως. 1 καὶ αλλοι] om καὶ d1 ‘or. ι’ || 2 τη ’δε] τω ’δε de || 3 ἄη] εχει b

8 ἀριθμω] τω ἀριθμω e2 32. 10 παλιν] η πάλιν ‘tres reg.’ 1. καἰ γὰρ καἰ ἄλλοι] elias suggests
the clementine passage which
is given by cotelierp. 528 (ed. 1672).
cp. tert. adv. prax. 8. 2. μη τω μεν] ‘to to see whether.’ 3. ταῦτα γὰρ κτλ.] the mouth,
the spring, and the stream are not
divided by time, nor is their continuity
with each other severed;
and yet the three have eacli their
special characteristics. 5. ῥύσιν] ‘an incessant waste, or
dissipation, of godhead.’
as in § 30. 8. εν εστιν ἀριθμω they are not
really three distinct things, gr.
thinks ; they are only various forms
or phases of the same thing, and
therefore they are inadequate to
express the trinity, which is essentially
three in number. 32. so with sun, ray, and light ;
or with the flickering sunshine reflected
from water upon a wall. 10. ηλιον κτλ] cp. tert. adv.
prax. 8. 11. κἀνταῦθα δεος] this illustration
likewise had its dangers. it
might have suggested that the
trinity is a trinity by some kind of
composition or combination, such
as the science of gr.’s time
between the su itself and the ray
and the light which were ‘in’ the
sun. cp. or. xliv 4. and secondly
there was the opposite danger of
suggesting that the father alone has
true positive being, while the son
and spirit are but faculties of his,
without personal subsistence, such
being in gr.’s view the character
the ray and the light. 5 θεω] + μόνω τω πατρὶ ‘reg. a’: + μόνω ‘duo coisl.’ || 6 ειρημενων]
προειρημενων ‘duo coisl.’ || 9 η ἀκτὶς] om η cd1f 2. ενυπαρχούσας] existing only
in him, as attributes of his. the
word is freq. in this sense in
aristtle. 3. ἄλλος ηλιος] this, ace. to gr.,
would be necessary to make the
illustration complete. cp. § 14, and
§ 30 ἄλλον θεόν. the ray is not the
equal of the luminous body which
gives it off; whereas in the trinity
there is, as it were, a sun giving off
a sun. 4. ηλιακαί τ. ἀπόρρ.] ‘solar
effluences’; gr. will not even
ηλίου ἀπόρρ., because it might suggest
that, once flowing forth, the
effluence has some kind of independent
existence, whereas his point
is that the ray and the light are but
properties of the sun. this is further
brought out by the addition
καὶ ποιότ. οὖσ’. ‘and essential qualities.’
by οὐσιωδεις gr. seems from
the context to mean ’belonging to the
nature of the sun.’ elsewhere,
the word is used in a way that
would give an almost opposite
meaning ; e.g. or. xli 11 οὐκετι ενεργείᾳ
παρὸν ως πρότερον, οὐσιωδως δε,
ως ἂν εἴποι τις, συγγινόμενον ; cyr.
hier. cat. myst. iii 1 πνεύματος
ἁγίου οὐσιωδης επιφοίτησις. ace. to
these examples, ποιότητες οὐσιωδεις
would rather mean ‘real, substantive
qualities.’ in order to suit
context, we should then have to
understand οὐσιωδεις to have something
of a concessive force, ‘qualities
after all, however real and
substantive.’ 5. καὶ ἄμα τὸ εἶναι κτλ.] the
gloss μόνω τω πατρί gives the right
direction for understanding the passage:
it means that if we are content
with the illustration, we attribute τὸ
εἶναι only to the father, and withhold
it from the son and spirit.
εν τούτοις = in the persons so conceived
of. thus to ‘god’ (in the
sense of ὅλος θεός iv 6) we should
‘attribute at the same time existence
and non-existence.’ 7. ηκουσα δε τινος] ‘i once heard
a man offering the following
it is unknown who the
man was. 8. μαρμαρυγην τινα] the illustration,
tration, though attractive to the
poetical imagination of gr., is not
immediately clear. it seems at first
as if the trinity were the sunbeam,
the water, and the wall, which
combine to produce the παλμός, the
dancing and quivering reflexion.
the point, however, appears to lie
rather in the junction of unity with
multiplicity (the number three being
for the moment lost sight of) displayed
in the vibrations of the
sunbeam.  ἀλλ’ οὐδε τοῦτο θεσθαι δυνατὸν εμοί, δι’ εν μεν,
ὅτι την μεν τὸ κινησαν καὶ πάνυ δηλον· θεοῦ δε οὐδεν
πρεσβύτερον, ἵν η τι τὸ τοῦτον κεκινηκός. αὐτὸς μεν γὰρ
πάντων αἰτία, αἰτίαν δε πρεσβυτεραν οὐκ εχει. δεύτερον
δε, ὅτι κἀνταῦθα των αὐτων ὑπόνοια, συνθεσεως, χύσεως, 1 σχεθεισα] χεθεισα ῾el.’ 33. 6 τουτο] τουτω ag ‘tres colb.’ || 
11 εννοητεον] cetera desunt in a 1. ὑπολαβοῦσα] ῾assuming,’
῾catching.’ ib. διὰ τοῦ εν μ. ἀερος] ῾by means
of the intervening air.’ ace.
gr.’s theory, it is the air
the water and the wall which communicates
to the sunbeam the motion
of the water. cp. ii 12, 13,
22. ib. σχεθεῖσσ τω ἀντ’.] ῾arrested by
the resisting substance.’ cp. ii 26
ἀντιτυπούμεναι. 2. παλμὸς εγ. καἰ παράδ.] ῾becomes
(gnom. aor.) α quivering that
quite surprises you.’ ib. ἄττει] = ἀίσσει, ῾vibrates.’ 33. it is α misleading comparison.
we do best to content ourselves
with the few words given us
by revelation for our guidance, and
so to press on through life, endeavouring
to bring all to join in worshipping
father, son, and holy
ghost, in one godhead. 6. θεσθαι] ῾to lay down as my
own.’ 7. την μεν τὸ κ.] ῾it is very
clear what moves the sumbeam.’
contrasted phrase would strictly
have run θεὸν δε οὐδεν κινεῖ οὐδόν
εστι τὸ κινοῦν). 10. των αὐτων ὑπ’.] ῾there is a
suspicion (or perh. a notion) of the
same things.’ things’ as in the case
former illustrations. ib. χύσεως] might seem to be in
favour of elias’ reading
above. but the point of the illustration
there does not lie in that
word, whether χεθ. be read, or
σχεθ’. χύσις represents the ῾shedding,’
whether of light or of water,
which implies dissipation. 11. ἀστάτου] repeats the στάσιν
οὐκ εχουσαν of § 31. cp. poem.
iii 64 οὔτε τις εξ ὑδάτων κινημασιν
ηλιακοῖσι μαρμαρυγη, τοίχοισι περίτρομος,
ἀστατεουσα, πρὶν πελάσαι
φεύγουσα, πάρος φυγεειν πελάουσα.
οὐδε γὰρ ἄστατός εστι θεοῦ φύσις, ηε
μούσα ηε πάλιν συνιοῦσα· τὸ δ’
εμπεδόν εστι θεοῖο. 12. την διάνοιαν ἵστησιν] ῾nothing
to satisfy my mind (lit. which brings
it to a stop) when i contemplate
illustrations the image which i
form.’ 8 διαπορεύεσθαι] διαπορθμεύεσθαι e || 9 om διατεμνοντα ῾tres colb.’ : τεμνοντα
d1 (ut videtur) || 11 καὶ] + βασίλειαν καὶ ῾reg. a’ || 12 om αἰωνων ce 1. ὑπ’ εὐγνωμοσύνης] the rhythm
is in favour of joining these words
to those which follow ; ῾have the
good sense to throw the rest away.’
for the use of the prep. cp. iv 7. 4. της ἅλ’. πλ. ἀποδεούσας] ῾quite
inadequate to express the truth.’ ib. της εύς. ενν. εχόμενον] ῾clinging
to the most reverent of views.’
cp. iv 15 sub fin. 5. επ’ ὀλίγων ῥ’. ἴστ’.] ῾satisfied
with a few (not with few) words.
the clause is contrasted with ἵστησιν
επὶ των ὑποδειγμάτων θ. above. ῾a
few words’ of scripture are all that
we have to go upon. 6. εντεῦθεν] = ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος. 8. διαπ. διατεμνοντα] ῾to journey
through this world, cleaving my way
as i go? there is a ref. to the
usual expression τεμνειν ὁδόν. gr.
alludes to the difficulties that beset
a faith which will not acquiesce in
poor substitutes for knowledge.
