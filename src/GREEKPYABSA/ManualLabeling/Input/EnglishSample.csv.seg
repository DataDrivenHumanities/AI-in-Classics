" cute   animals .   bought   annual   pass ,   and   we   have   visited   3x   now . "
" fantastic   place   to   go   with   the   whole   family .   the   tickets   are   slightly   on   the   higher   side   but   the   experience   is   worth   it .   the   animals   appear   to   be   well   looked   after   and   cared   for .   there   is   heaps   of   animals   that   roam   freely   that   you   can   touch ,   pat   and   feed .   im   very   impressed   overall .   the   cafe   is   also   very   lovely   with   amazing   food .
