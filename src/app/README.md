Current issues:
  Debug mode won't always stay, so currently set to always be debug mode
Code Structure 
  app.py - holds the 3 tasks and the app output itself
  app_functions.py - holds the callback functions for all the functions
  load.py - holds the functions for load fn
  query.py - holds the functions for query fn
  analyze.py  - holds the functions for analyze fn
  globals.py - the dictionary for global variables. One of these objects that every functions imports and references 
  tmp.py - temp/scratch work file
Future work:
  Previously saved in load.py 
  integrate our makeCSVUpdated.py into the load function (input path the xmls and you end up with the CSV)
